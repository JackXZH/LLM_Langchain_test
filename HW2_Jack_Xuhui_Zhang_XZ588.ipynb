The net-zero transition will shift employment away from \\noil, gas, and automotive manufacturing and into green industries for a modest net gain in \\nemployment. Infrastructure projects will increase demand in construction, which is already \\nshort almost 400,000 workers today. We also see increased demand for healthcare workers \\nas the population ages, plus gains in transportation services due to e-commerce.\\n —An additional 12 million occupational transitions may be needed by 2030.

Months after MGI released its last report on the future of work in America, the world \\nfound itself battling a global pandemic.1 Since then, the US job market has come roaring back \\nfrom its sudden drop. The nature of work has changed as many workers have stuck with remote \\nor hybrid models and employers have sped up their adoption of automation technologies. More \\nrecently, the accelerated development of generative AI, with its advanced natural language \\ncapabilities, has extended the possibilities for automation to a much wider set of occupations. \\nAmid this disruption, workers changed jobs at a remarkable pace—and a subset made bigger \\nleaps and moved into entirely different occupations. Some 8.6 million occupational shifts took \\nplace from 2019 through 2022. Now even more change is in store. We expect an additional \\n12 million occupational shifts by 2030. The total number of transitions through 2030 could be \\n25 percent higher than we projected a little over two years ago.2 \\nMultiple forces are set to fuel growth in certain occupations and erode jobs in others. They \\ngenerally fall into three categories: automation, including generative AI; an injection of federal \\ninvestment into infrastructure and the net-zero transition; and long-term structural trends such \\nas aging, continuing investment in technology, and the growth of e-commerce and remote work. \\nWe do not forecast how aggregated employment may be affected by the business cycle in the \\nshort term; instead, we focus on how these forces may reshape the composition of labor demand \\nover the long term. \\nAcross a majority of occupations (employing 75 percent of the workforce), the pandemic \\naccelerated trends that could persist through the end of the decade. Occupations that took a hit \\nduring the downturn are likely to continue shrinking over time. These include customer-facing \\nroles affected by the shift to e-commerce and office support roles that could be eliminated \\neither by automation or by fewer people coming into physical offices. Declines in food services, \\ncustomer service and sales, office support, and production work could account for almost  \\nten million (more than 84 percent) of the 12 million occupational shifts expected by 2030. \\n1  The future of work in America: People and places, today and tomorrow , McKinsey Global Institute, July 2019.\\n2  The future of work after COVID-19, McKinsey Global Institute, February 2021.\\nMultiple forces are set to fuel \\ngrowth in certain occupations \\nand erode jobs in others. \\n1 McKinsey Global Institute | Generative AI and the future of work in America', metadata={'source': 'generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america-vf1.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='Workers have shown a willingness \\nto change career paths, while \\na tighter labor market has \\nencouraged companies to hire \\nfrom broader applicant pools.By contrast, occupations in business and legal professions, management, healthcare, \\ntransportation, and STEM were resilient during the pandemic and are poised for continued \\ngrowth. These categories are expected to see fewer than one million occupational shifts \\nby 2030. \\nFor the other categories that account for the remaining one million occupational shifts still to \\ncome, the pandemic was a temporary headwind. Employment in fields like education and training \\nshould rise in the years ahead amid a continuous need for early education and lifelong learning. \\nDemand for construction workers also stalled during the height of the pandemic but is expected \\nto rebound strongly. \\nThe changes estimated in our earlier research are happening even faster and on an even bigger \\nscale than expected. It is becoming even more urgent to solve occupational and geographic \\nmismatches and connect workers with the training they need to land jobs with better prospects. \\nThe fact that workers have been willing to pivot and change career paths, while a tighter labor \\nmarket encouraged companies to hire from broader applicant pools, gives cause for optimism—\\nbut not complacency. The future of work is already here, and it’s moving fast.\\nIn a tighter labor market, workers have been moving \\ninto new roles, accelerating occupational shifts\\nBy the end of 2022, employment had bounced back to its 2019 level. But a great deal was in flux. \\nAre pandemic-era labor shortages here to stay? \\nThe quits rate soared to new heights during the pandemic, with roughly 48 million Americans \\nleaving their jobs in 2021 and 51 million in 2022. What people did next is not fully evident from \\nthe data. Some moved into better jobs with higher pay. Others left the labor force, whether out of \\ndiscouragement or for personal or health reasons, and it is unclear if or when they will return.\\nTotal employment hit an all-time high after the pandemic, with many employers encountering \\nhiring difficulties. As of April 2023, some ten million positions remained vacant; labor force \\nparticipation had ticked up but was 0.7 percentage point below its prepandemic level. That \\ntranslates into roughly 1.9 million workers who are neither employed nor actively looking for jobs. \\nThis erosion comes after an extended 20-year trend of steadily falling participation. \\nLabor supply may continue to be constrained, given that one in four Americans will be of \\nretirement age or older by 2030. Without higher participation rates, increased immigration, \\nor meaningful productivity growth, labor shortages could be a lasting issue as the economy \\nand the population grow. This remains an open question confronting markets, economists, \\nand employers. \\n2 McKinsey Global Institute | Generative AI and the future of work in America', metadata={'source': 'generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america-vf1.pdf', 'page': 9}), Document(page_content='3 McKinsey Global Institute | Generative AI and the future of work in AmericaFast food and counter workers\\n Note: Figures may not sum to 100%, due to rounding.\\n/one.numr“Occupational shifts” refers to net declines in employment in speci/f_ic occupations \\nbetween 2019 and 2022.

A subset of people did more than change employers; they moved \\ninto different occupations altogether. Based on net increases and decreases in employment, \\nsome 8.6 million occupational shifts took place from 2019 through 2022—50 percent more than \\nin the previous three-year period (Exhibit E1).3 While it is impossible to trace individual moves, \\nmany people left their previous roles and landed better-paying jobs in other occupations.\\nThe majority of these shifts came from people leaving jobs in food services, customer service and \\nsales, office support, and production work (such as manufacturing). At the same time, managerial \\nand professional roles plus transportation services collectively added close to four million jobs \\nfrom 2019 to 2022. Our previous research had anticipated these types of changes over a longer \\ntime frame, but the pandemic suddenly accelerated matters. The past few years have been a \\npreview of trends we expect to continue through the end of the decade.\\nMore high-wage jobs—and fewer workers taking lower-wage service jobs\\nOverall employment in low- and middle-wage occupations has fallen from prepandemic levels, \\nwhile occupations that pay more than $57,000 annually added about 3.5 million jobs. However, it \\nis unclear how many higher-paying roles were filled by people who moved up and how many were \\nfilled by new entrants to the labor force. Meanwhile, the number of lower-wage job openings has \\nnot declined. Demand for lower-wage service work remains, but fewer workers are accepting \\nthese roles. \\nWhat is clear from the job switching and occupational shifts of the past three years is that the \\nUS labor market accommodated a higher level of dynamic movement. Spiking demand and \\nlabor scarcity forced many employers to consider nontraditional candidates with potential and \\ntrain them if they lacked direct experience. While this may not hold in the future, employers and \\nworkers alike can draw on what they have learned about the potential for people to make quick \\npivots and add new skills.\\n3 Measured as net job losses for individual occupations across sectors, net of estimated retirements; derived from US Bureau \\nof Labor Statistics (BLS) data. An administrative assistant who takes a similar position with another employer has simply \\nswitched jobs and is not part of this analysis. If that person becomes an office manager, they have changed occupations \\nwithin the same category (office support). If they become a computer systems analyst, they have moved into a different \\noccupational category (STEM professionals). The latter two moves are the kind of occupational shifts that we measure. Since \\nwe are unable to trace exactly how individual workers moved, we use net declines as a broad proxy. In our forward-looking \\nscenario, we refer to people needing to make transitions if demand is projected to decline in their current occupation.Automation and other forces will continue to reshape the labor market \\nAutomation, from industrial robots to automated document processing systems, continues to \\nbe the biggest factor in changing the demand for various occupations. Generative AI is both \\naccelerating automation and extending it to an entirely new set of occupations. While this \\ntechnology is advancing rapidly, other forces are also affecting labor demand. Overall, we expect \\nsignificant shifts in the occupational mix in the United States through the end of the decade. \\nThe effects of automation and generative AI\\nAutomation has taken a leap forward with the recent introduction of generative AI tools. \\n“Generative” refers to the fact that these tools can identify patterns across enormous sets of data \\nand generate new content—an ability that has often been considered uniquely human. Their most \\nstriking advance is in natural language capabilities, which are required for a large number of work \\nactivities.

Some 3.5 million jobs could be displaced through direct and indirect effects across \\nthe economy. But at the macro level, these losses should be more than offset by gains of \\n4.2 million jobs, primarily led by capital expenditures on renewable energy. The net-zero \\ntransition will likely be a net positive for jobs, but those jobs may be located in different places \\nand require different skills. \\nSimilarly, major investment in infrastructure projects across the country will bolster \\nconstruction jobs, which could see employment growth of 12 percent from 2022 through \\n2030. However, the sector already had some 383,000 unfilled positions in April 2023. This \\nshortage will have to be addressed to bring infrastructure projects to life from coast to coast.6 \\nThe CHIPS and Science Act is putting additional funding into semiconductor manufacturing \\nas well as R&D and scientific research.7 This comes at a time when some companies have \\nbeen adjusting their supply chains, leading to an uptick in domestic manufacturing. While \\nmanufacturing is likely to boost employment demand overall in the years ahead, the sector is \\nbecoming more high-tech. It will involve fewer traditional production jobs than in the past but \\nmore workers with technical and STEM skills.8 \\n —Other structural trends: At the same time, other trends like rising incomes and education \\nlevels will sustain jobs. An aging population will need more healthcare workers in multiple \\nroles, while the ongoing process of digitizing the economy will require adding more tech \\nworkers in every sector.\\n5  While our scenario includes the impact of federal investment in the net-zero transition and infrastructure, it does not include \\nthe full impact of the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, since implementation remained unclear at the \\ntime of this analysis.

Automation could jump-start lackluster \\nproductivity while simultaneously easing labor shortages. \\nGenerative AI has the potential to increase US labor productivity by 0.5 to 0.9 percentage \\npoints annually through 2030 in a midpoint adoption scenario. The range reflects whether the \\ntime freed up by automation is redeployed at 2022 productivity levels or 2030 levels, with both \\nscenarios accounting for the occupational mix expected in 2030.\\nCombining generative AI with all other automation technologies, the potential growth could be \\neven larger. All types of automation could help drive US productivity growth to 3 to 4 percent \\nannually in a midpoint adoption scenario. However, this will require significant action from \\nstakeholders across the public and private sector. Workers will need support in learning new \\nskills, and other risks associated with generative AI also need to be mitigated and controlled. But \\nif worker transitions and risks are well managed, generative AI could contribute substantively to \\neconomic growth.\\nTo capture the full benefits of generative AI to make knowledge work more productive, \\nemployers, policy makers, and broader ecosystems would need to establish clear guidelines \\nand guardrails—and workers would need to see these tools not as job destroyers but as work \\nenhancers. When machines take over dull or unpleasant tasks, people can be left with more \\ninteresting work that requires creativity, problem-solving, and collaborating with others.

When managers automate more of their administrative and \\nreporting tasks, for example, they can spend more time on strategic thinking and coaching. \\nSimilarly, researchers could speed up projects by relying on automation tools to sort and \\nsynthesize large data sets. \\nFor employers, doubling down on innovative hiring strategies\\nMost employers can benefit from using a broader lens in hiring.

Employers \\nmay need to reconsider whether some credential requirements are really necessary. Some \\n60 percent of US workers have skills gained through experience but lack four-year college \\ndegrees.

A robust recovery \\nmarked by job \\nswitching and \\nlabor shortages \\nGaining a clearer picture of how America’s future of work could shape up through the end of this \\ndecade involves taking the nation’s new starting point into account. More than two years after \\nthe initial COVID-19 shutdowns, the US labor market has regained its footing, with the economy \\ncontinuing to add jobs steadily. The unemployment rate dipped below 4 percent at the beginning \\nof 2022 and has remained there through the first half of 2023.\\nAgainst the backdrop of a tight labor market, a massive wave of job switching occurred. About \\n48 million people quit their jobs in 2021, followed by 51 million in 2022. With openings readily \\navailable, many workers felt empowered to seek out new positions that offered higher pay or \\nbetter alignment with priorities such as flexibility or opportunities to advance.20\\nA subset of those people did more than simply change employers while doing essentially the \\nsame job. They moved into different occupations altogether, accelerating shifts in the mix of \\nemployment that our ongoing body of research has been anticipating. In this chapter, we take \\nstock of these recent changes, which inform the updated baseline and reaffirm some of the \\ndrivers of labor demand used in our refreshed research. \\n20 See, for example, Jo Constanz, “The Great Resignation worked: Most job-swappers got a raise,” Bloomberg, July 29, 2022; \\nand Te-Ping Chen, “Better pay and career paths drive US workers’ decisions to quit,” Wall Street Journal,  March 9, 2022.\\n21 As of this writing, 2022 is the latest year with detailed data on employment by occupation; see “Occupational Employment \\nand Wage Statistics,” US Bureau of Labor Statistics.The pandemic changed the mix of employment, with \\ntougher implications for workers with less education \\nFrom the very start of the pandemic, it was evident that demand would rachet up for some types \\nof work and dry up for others, simply due to which occupations were deemed essential or could \\nbe performed remotely. This unevenness has held true throughout the recovery (Exhibit 1).21 \\nThese changes offer a preview of trends that we expect to continue through the end of \\nthe decade.\\nManagerial roles and business, legal, and STEM professions were resilient during the pandemic, \\nsince these jobs could be done remotely and were often critical to helping businesses navigate \\nnew challenges. These categories added 3.3 million jobs from 2019 to 2022. At the same time, \\ne-commerce fueled growth in transportation services—specifically in warehousing. Jobs for \\nstockers and order fillers, for example, grew by more than 30 percent between 2019 to 2022, \\nwhile shipping, receiving, and inventory clerks grew by about 15 percent. These trends are likely \\nto continue. \\n15 McKinsey Global Institute | Generative AI and the future of work in America', metadata={'source': 'generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america-vf1.pdf', 'page': 22}), Document(page_content='Most other occupational groups did not recover so quickly, and the categories that took the \\nbiggest hits are likely to continue declining. During the height of the pandemic, many food service \\njobs were lost. Once businesses reopened their doors, however, they struggled to hire and retain \\nworkers. While total employment in the leisure and hospitality sector remained down throughout \\n2021, it has largely recovered. But as of April 2023, employment specifically in accommodation \\nand food services was still slightly below prepandemic levels, with about 40 percent more job \\nopenings than before the pandemic. \\nCustomer service and sales roles decreased throughout the pandemic as many brick-and-\\nmortar retail locations closed. They have recovered slowly; as of 2022, customer service \\nemployment was still 8 percent below its 2019 level, which equates to 1.3 million fewer jobs. Much \\nof this is due to consumers’ changing preferences for e-commerce.22\\nOffice support remained 1 percent below its 2019 levels as of 2022. In a recent McKinsey \\nsurvey, nearly half of respondents said the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated their organization’s \\ndeployment of automation technologies such as intelligent document management and \\nprocessing tools.23 Office clerks, secretaries, and tellers were most affected, a trend that is likely \\nto continue as automation continues to become more ubiquitous.\\nThe recovery in healthcare employment is more nuanced.

In the economic recovery, the United States developed a labor shortage \\nAs of May 2023, total employment stood at two million above its prepandemic level. While labor \\nforce participation has ticked back up, it remained 0.7 percentage point below where it was \\nin February 2020. That translates into roughly 1.9 million fewer workers at a time when about \\nten million positions remained vacant. The job market was also tight in 2018 and 2019, but the \\npostpandemic labor shortage has been even more pronounced. In fact, taking a longer historical \\nview, labor force participation has been steadily falling, from 67.3 percent in January 2000 to \\n62.6 percent in May 2023. \\nDespite a wave of white-collar layoffs in 2023 that received substantial media coverage, the job \\nmarket has remained robust overall, especially for blue-collar workers.25 Many employers have \\nbeen coping with unfilled positions and competing for talent. This has driven wages upward, in \\nstark contrast to the prolonged weak jobs recovery that followed the Great Recession of 2008. \\nWhere are the workers?\\nA great deal of uncertainty surrounds the current labor shortage. It is unclear whether people \\nhave left the labor force permanently or might return. Several drivers help to explain at least part \\nof what is going on and shed light on who might be drawn back in to meet future demand and fill \\nmore of the ten million positions that are vacant today as well as those that will be created at a \\ntime when the workforce is shrinking due to aging.26\\n —People have retired.  According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), labor force \\nparticipation for Americans over age 65 fell from 20.8 percent in February 2020 to \\n19.1 percent in May 2023. Additionally, some workers in their late 50s and early 60s exited \\nthe workforce early. One study estimates that half of the recent increase in retirements was \\ndriven by “excess retirements” above the prepandemic trend line. This translates into roughly \\n1.6 million missing older workers.27 \\n —People have quit. During the pandemic, an unprecedented number of workers headed for \\nthe exits, roughly a third of whom left without having their next jobs lined up.28 While many \\npeople landed new positions, others appear to have left the workforce, whether temporarily \\nor permanently. \\n17 McKinsey Global Institute | Generative AI and the future of work in America', metadata={'source': 'generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america-vf1.pdf', 'page': 24}), Document(page_content=' —Health concerns are taking a significant if hard-to-measure toll.  While data is scarce, \\nsome people stricken with COVID-19 struggle with long-term effects that hamper their \\nability to work.29 In addition, studies have documented a rise in burnout and mental \\nhealth challenges.30 \\n —Immigration was stalled for an extended period. Immigrants have always been part of \\nthe American labor force. But migration into the United States began dropping in 2016, and \\npandemic-related restrictions accelerated the decline further. The number of foreign-born \\nworkers experienced a sharp decline from the onset of the pandemic. In 2016, more than \\na million immigrants (including asylum seekers, students, and holders of both work and \\nimmigrant visas) entered the country. By 2021, that number was down to fewer than 400,000. \\nThose annual drops compound over time. Keeping 2014–16 levels of net international \\nmigration in place, for example, would have added 1.7 million people over 2017–21. However, \\nimmigration is estimated to have rebounded in 2022, with net international migration \\nreturning to 2018 levels.31 The foreign-born share of the US labor force was higher than the \\nprepandemic level as of May 2023.32\\nWhether current hiring difficulties turn out to be a preview of a lasting structural issue is the \\nquestion of the moment for markets, economists, and employers; it is also the subject of \\nforthcoming research from MGI. What we do know is that the tight environment is driving home \\nthe urgency of ensuring that critical occupations are filled and that people have opportunities to \\nadd the skills required to move into these roles. \\n29 Katie Bach, “New data shows long Covid is keeping as many as 4 million people out of work,” Brookings Institution, August \\n2022.

Rubin and Rosie Ettenheim, “Immigrants’ share of the U.S. labor force grows to a new high,” Wall Street Journal , May \\n22, 2023.\\n33 We measure occupational shifts as net job losses for individual occupations across sectors, net of estimated retirements; \\nderived from BLS data. An administrative assistant who leaves one employer to take a similar position with another has simply \\nswitched jobs and is not part of this analysis. If that person becomes an office manager, they have changed occupations \\nwithin the same category (office support). If they become a computer systems analyst, they have moved into a different \\noccupational category (STEM professionals). The latter two moves are the kind of occupational shifts that we measure. Since \\nwe are unable to trace exactly how individual workers moved, we use net declines as a broad proxy for how labor demand and \\nsupply have changed across occupations. In our forward-looking scenario, we refer to people needing to make transitions if \\nlabor demand in their current occupation is projected to decline.Millions of workers not only changed jobs but \\nmade bigger leaps into new occupations \\nThe Great Attrition saw Americans switching jobs in record numbers. Within that group, a \\nsignificant subset of people not only changed employers but took up entirely new lines of work.\\nWe estimate that some 8.6 million occupational shifts took place between 2019 and 2022—an \\nincrease of almost 50 percent from the preceding three-year period.33 Declines in food services, \\ncustomer service and sales, office support, and production accounted for more than half of these \\ntransitions (Exhibit 2). Losses in these categories are part of a longer-term structural change that \\nwe expect to continue. \\n18 McKinsey Global Institute | Generative AI and the future of work in America', metadata={'source': 'generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america-vf1.pdf', 'page': 25}), Document(page_content='19 McKinsey Global Institute | Generative AI and the future of work in AmericaFast food and counter workers\\n Note: Figures may not sum to 100%, due to rounding.\\n/one.numr“Occupational shifts” refers to net declines in employment in speci/f_ic occupations \\nbetween 2019 and 2022.

Job gains and losses \\nthrough 2030 \\nIt is impossible to know exactly what lies ahead, especially in the short term. Yet we can piece \\ntogether a picture of how multiple trends might change the mix of jobs in the US economy by the \\nend of the decade.36 \\nWhile automation has the biggest impact, our research incorporates a much broader range of \\nfactors. These include shifts that were accelerated by the pandemic and appear to be lasting, \\nincluding increased remote work and virtual meetings that have reduced demand for business \\ntravel as well as consumers embracing e-commerce. We also weigh federal investment in \\ninfrastructure and the net-zero transition, as well as ongoing investment to digitize the economy, \\nrising incomes and education levels, the healthcare needs of an aging population, and the \\npotential marketization of unpaid domestic and care work. In addition, we assume that some \\nnew occupations may be created at similar rates as in the past. This approach builds on previous \\nMGI research on the future of work as well as McKinsey’s just-published report on generative AI \\nmore specifically.37 \\nThe resulting analysis shows which occupations can expect to see growing demand and which \\nare likely to see job losses. As a result of these changes, we estimate that another 11.8 million \\noccupational transitions could occur by 2030. This is on top of the 8.6 million occupational \\nshifts that took place from 2019 to 2022. Understanding the nuances of how this might play \\nout and who might be affected is critical to ensuring a smooth transition for individuals and \\nbusinesses alike. \\n36 We do not attempt to forecast how employment may be affected by the business cycle in the short term.

Healthcare \\njobs are expected to have the highest demand growth, with a 30 percent increase for health \\nprofessionals and similar growth for health aides, technicians, and wellness professionals \\n(Exhibit 4). An aging population increases the need for specialized healthcare. In fact, four of the \\nten largest job-creating occupations in our analysis are healthcare roles. Keeping the ratio of \\nhealthcare workers to the population over age 65 roughly constant with today’s level in 2030, \\nwe estimate that 3.8 million jobs could be added for registered nurses, personal care assistants, \\nhome health aides, nursing assistants, licensed practical and vocational nurses, and medical \\nassistants. The imbalance between supply and demand is already evident. Many hospitals and \\nnursing homes are coping with staffing shortages that can affect the quality of care.40 \\nJobs in STEM fields are estimated to grow by 23 percent by 2030. This equates to an average \\nannual growth rate of 2.6 percent, which represents an acceleration from the past few years. The \\ntop-growing occupations include software developers, computer systems analysts, and data \\nscientists.

Against this backdrop, the arrival of ChatGPT \\nwas another seismic event. Some users who initially tried out ChatGPT and the other generative \\nAI tools that quickly followed were drawn by curiosity. In subsequent months, many have already \\nbegun to use these tools to assist in a range of work tasks. \\nOther forces are at work, too. One of the biggest recent developments has been the passage \\nof legislation that will put significant federal investment into decarbonizing the economy and \\nmodernizing America’s infrastructure. \\n46 Andrew R. Chow, “How ChatGPT managed to grow faster than TikTok or Instagram,” Time , February 8, 2023.Generative AI and other automation technologies can \\nhandle a growing range of work activities\\nRarely has a tech innovation created such a splash as ChatGPT, which has achieved one of the \\nfastest adoption rates in history.46 But what is it exactly, and how could it affect jobs? We consider \\nit alongside other automation technologies, many of which are already having major effects, from \\nrobots on factory floors to automated document processing in back-office functions.  \\nWhat is generative AI?\\nPart of the field known as deep learning, generative AI refers to applications typically built using \\na class of artificial neural networks called foundation models, structures inspired by the billions of \\nneurons connected in the human brain. These models have taken AI applications to the next level. \\nChatGPT is only one of several new generative AI tools. The “generative” in the name refers to its \\nability to identify patterns across enormous sets of data and generate new content—something \\nthat has often been considered uniquely human. ChatGPT can be used to write correspondence, \\nessays, articles, stories, poetry, and computer code, in addition to scraping the internet for \\ninformation and answering questions.\\nAnother AI tool, Dall-E, can create images and illustrations in multiple styles. Dall-E and similar \\nimage generators were “trained” by absorbing huge quantities of images and reading their \\ncaptions. They can produce new images as specified by users, in a variety of styles, and even \\ntake stories and turn them into illustrated storyboards. Other AI systems from major platforms \\ncan generate images, video, audio, and text. \\n31 McKinsey Global Institute | Generative AI and the future of work in America', metadata={'source': 'generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america-vf1.pdf', 'page': 38}), Document(page_content='Much of the buzz today is about users interacting with these systems for fun or to satisfy \\ntheir curiosity. But the potential applications for businesses are exceptionally wide-ranging. \\nGenerative AI can be used to write code, design products, create marketing content and \\nstrategies, streamline operations, analyze legal documents, provide customer service via \\nchatbots, or even accelerate scientific discovery. The ability to generate images is the first step \\ntoward creating immersive experiences. \\nGenerative AI is still in the early stages, and these tools are far from perfect. They can produce \\ninaccurate results, and many legal, ethical, and intellectual property questions still need to \\nbe resolved.\\nWhat types of work can it do?\\nOne of the biggest leaps forward in AI is in natural language capabilities, which are required for \\na large number of work activities. Previously, these were not expected to match median human \\nperformance for natural language understanding until around 2028 at the earliest, but they are \\nalready reaching that point today. \\nThese advances mean that automation is about to affect a wider set of work activities. As a \\nresult, the share of hours spent on work tasks today across the US economy that have the \\ntechnical potential  to be automated with currently demonstrated technologies has jumped from \\n44 percent to 62 percent in our midpoint scenario.47 \\nBut technical potential does not always match what happens on the ground. It is the theoretical \\nmaximum that could be automated, considering current technological capabilities at any \\ngiven time. But not everything that could  be done in a theoretical world would be adopted by \\nbusinesses. The pace of actual adoption typically lags behind technical potential. It is affected \\nby the time needed for solution integration, whether it is economically feasible to replace human \\nlabor with technology, and multiple other barriers such as customer acceptance, labor laws, and \\ncompanies lacking the right workforce skills. \\nYet the introduction of generative AI has sharply accelerated the timeline for automation \\nadoption,  since these tools are easy to access and integrate and are relatively low cost. Without \\ngenerative AI, we estimate that automation could take over tasks accounting for 21.5 percent of \\nthe hours currently worked in the US economy by 2030. With it, that share jumps to 29.5 percent \\n(Exhibit 7).48 This includes a significant increase in tasks involving expertise, interactions with \\npeople, and even creativity.49 Tasks requiring physical work, by contrast, are expected to be \\nless affected. \\n47 The midpoint scenario is the average of the early and late automation adoption scenarios referenced in McKinsey’s recent \\nreport The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier (June 2023).\\n48 This is the average of a very wide range, from 3.7 to 55.3 percent.\\n49 Thomas H.

EVs \\nhave fewer moving parts than traditional internal combustion \\nengines, which makes their production less labor-intensive. \\nThis may result in job losses for assembly line workers, \\nmolders, and machinists. \\nEven as demand falls for traditional automotive production \\nroles, automakers will need more tech-oriented workers, \\nfrom software developers and IT managers to computer \\nhardware engineers. EVs require expertise in chemical \\nand electronic engineering in their design, testing, and \\nrepair. 3 The industry will have a heavier emphasis on \\nelectronics, mechatronics and calibration, advanced \\nmaterials, and additive manufacturing. There may be a need to repurpose engineering talent toward electrical and \\nelectronics specialties.\\nEVs run on thousands of chips—in fact, roughly double the \\nnumber found in conventional vehicles.4 Manufacturers ran \\ninto shortages in 2022, and McKinsey has estimated that \\nautomotive semiconductor demand could rise by about \\n11 percent annually through 2030. The CHIPS and Science \\nAct of 2022 aims to address US reliance on imported \\nchips by directing $280 billion toward US semiconductor \\ncapabilities, including domestic manufacturing, high-tech \\nregional hubs, and developing the nation’s STEM workforce. \\nIntel has broken ground on a new $20 billion semiconductor \\nfactory in Ohio; this is on top of $20 billion to expand \\nits production footprint in Arizona, a state that has also \\ncaptured one of the largest foreign investments in US history \\nfrom chip giant TSMC.5\\nNew types of jobs associated with EVs are already growing \\nas production takes root in states including California, \\nGeorgia, Michigan, North Carolina, and Tennessee. \\nEstablished automakers are opening battery hubs \\nin Kentucky, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and \\nTennessee. Additional jobs will be created to produce and \\ninstall charging equipment and infrastructure nationwide.\\nIn 2022, the infrastructure law was followed by the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes an \\nadditional $369 billion in complementary funding. Its provisions are meant to spur domestic \\nmanufacturing and energy efficiency upgrades, decarbonize and shore up the US electric grid, \\nestablish a national green bank, and improve resilience in agriculture and rural areas.63 However, \\nboth pieces of legislation establish myriad programs, with much of the funding directed toward \\nstate and local governments through competitive grants. Coordination and implementation will \\nbe complex, and the full impact will take time to manifest.64 \\nFrom a labor market perspective, the United States will need to address its existing shortage of \\nconstruction workers to realize these plans. Employment has stalled, but demand is growing. We \\nestimate that jobs in the construction sector could increase by 12 percent by 2030, translating to \\n63 Savannah Bertrand, “How the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law work together to advance climate \\naction,” Environmental and Energy Study Institute, September 2022.\\n64 See, for example, “Delivering on the promise of federal infrastructure funds in states,” McKinsey & Company, May 2022; and \\n“A new era of infrastructure grants,” McKinsey & Company, May 2022.\\n39 McKinsey Global Institute | Generative AI and the future of work in America', metadata={'source': 'generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america-vf1.pdf', 'page': 46}), Document(page_content='more than a million net jobs gained, in addition to growth in affiliated sectors. The construction \\nsector could also see significant increases in labor demand from other factors, such as the need \\nto rebuild in the aftermath of natural disasters.65 \\nIn the peak years of infrastructure spending, about half of the demand for labor may come from \\ncontractor roles in the construction industry itself. Another large share, just over 40 percent, \\nis likely to come from the materials sector, which combines manufacturing, distribution, and \\nwarehousing.66 This part of the value chain is equally important, since delays and shortages in \\nobtaining materials can grind construction projects to a halt or drive up their costs.\\nIn terms of specific occupations within the sector, our estimates indicate that construction \\nlaborers (with 240,000 positions added), supervisors (150,000), and electricians (130,000) could \\nexperience the largest growth in demand by 2030. \\nYet the United States already has a shortage of construction workers. Some 490,000 positions \\nwere unfilled in December 2022—the highest number recorded since industry-level data \\ncollection began in 2000. This number dropped slightly to roughly 383,000 positions in May \\n2023. In September and December 2022, unfilled construction positions exceeded the number \\nof unemployed individuals seeking construction jobs. This imbalance is caused by a mix of \\nshort-term, cyclical, and more structural factors. The workforce is getting older, with the share \\nof construction workers age 55 and older having doubled, from 11 to 22.7 percent, between \\n2003 and 2022. The industry is also heavily reliant on immigrants (who represent more than \\na quarter of construction workers) at a time when immigration is only now picking up after a \\ndrop of several years. In addition, women make up only about 10 percent of the construction \\nsector’s workforce.67\\nMost infrastructure development companies are competing with other industries when it comes \\nto skilled trades. A large number of welders, for example, will be needed in both manufacturing \\nand construction, and without cooperation to train new talent, competition for this small pool \\nof skilled tradespeople will only increase. In fact, people with skills crucial to the construction \\nindustry have broader options. There is competing demand in both construction and logistics for \\ntruck drivers and freight movers, who are already in short supply. The same goes for electricians, \\nwho can work for construction companies or utilities.\\nAddressing these labor shortages is an opportunity to diversify the construction workforce. \\nAccording to the BLS, nine out of ten US construction workers are men; 30 percent are Hispanic; \\nand almost 61 percent are non-Hispanic White. Recruiting and training more women and people \\nof color can help companies meet the coming demand while diversifying their own workforces \\nand expanding opportunity more broadly.\\n65 See, for example, Maria Sacchetti, “Florida needs workers to rebuild after Ian.

Binder and John Bound, The declining labor market prospects of less-educated men, NBER \\nworking paper number 25577, February 2019.Based on the demographics of various jobs today, workers in lower-wage roles, those with less \\neducation, women, and people of color are disproportionately represented among those who \\nmay need to find new types of work by 2030 (Exhibit 14). Workers with these profiles are more \\nvulnerable to job displacement and will need support to make successful job transitions. \\n —Workers in lower-wage jobs are up to 14 times more likely to face the need to change \\noccupations.  We estimate that almost 80 percent of all potential transitions (affecting some \\n9.4 million people) could occur among workers in the two lowest quintiles of wages—that \\nis, people earning less than $38,200. Retail salespeople, cashiers, and stockers and order \\nfillers all fall within the lowest quintile and could account for some 18 percent of all potential \\ntransitions by 2030. But notably, the most vulnerable group overall is not the very lowest \\nwage bracket; it is those earning between $30,800 and $38,200. This group specifically is  \\n14 times more likely to need to find new roles by 2030 than the highest-wage earners. \\n —Workers without college degrees are 1.7 times more likely to face displacement and \\nthe need to change occupations than those with bachelor’s degrees or above. It is well \\nestablished that workers with a high school diploma or less have experienced limited job \\nprospects in the United States.69 Assuming the distribution of educational attainment levels \\nacross occupations remains the same as in 2022, workers without bachelor’s degrees could \\naccount for about 8.9 million of the estimated 11.8 million occupational shifts (roughly three-\\nquarters of the total). Notably, 90 percent of production workers are not college educated, \\nand about 1.4 million may need to change fields by 2030. Similarly, 72 percent of office \\nsupport workers lack college degrees, and about 4.7 million may need to move to different \\noccupations. Higher levels of educational attainment remain strongly positively correlated \\nwith being in less automatable roles. \\n —The youngest and oldest workers are 1.4 and 1.1 times more likely to face occupational \\nchanges, respectively.  In our estimates, workers between the ages of 18 and 24 and those \\nabove age 50 are more likely to face job transitions than workers ages 25 to 49. As younger \\nworkers are just starting their careers and many are likely still attending school, they may be \\nbetter positioned to adapt and find different pathways. But older workers may find it harder to \\nstart new chapters. \\n —Women are 1.5 times more likely to face occupational transitions than men. Women could \\nface 57 percent of all the transitions envisioned in our estimates, which is greater than their \\noverall workforce representation of 47 percent. This reflects the fact that women are heavily \\nrepresented in office support and customer service roles, which could shrink by about \\n3.7 million and 2.0 million jobs, respectively, by 2030.\\n —Hispanic workers are 1.1 times more likely to need to change occupations than White \\nworkers . Based on the jobs they hold today, Hispanic Americans could account for 2.1 million \\npotential job transitions (18 percent of the total through 2030). Much of this is driven by \\nrelatively higher representation in automatable food service roles. \\n —Black workers are 1.1 times more likely t o face occupational changes than White workers. \\nSome 1.5 million Black Americans could face the need to change roles, accounting for \\n12 percent of all estimated transitions. While the magnitude may seem relatively small, Black \\nAmericans have experienced higher unemployment rates than White workers since the \\nCensus Bureau Current Population Survey began publishing data in 1972. Ensuring that Black \\nworkers in shrinking occupations have pathways to move into high-quality jobs can help to \\nrelieve labor supply constraints while creating a more inclusive economy. \\n47 McKinsey Global Institute | Generative AI and the future of work in America', metadata={'source': 'generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america-vf1.pdf', 'page': 54}), Document(page_content='48 McKinsey Global Institute | Generative AI and the future of work in America\\nWeb 2023\\nfuture-of-work\\nExhibit 19 of 21\\nNational\\naverage:\\n7.5%More\\nlikely to \\nchange \\njobs\\nLess\\nlikely to \\nchange \\njobsWage/two.numr Education Age GenderRace/\\nethnicity\\n12\\n9\\n6\\n3\\n015\\nLow\\nLowest\\nMiddleBachelor’s\\ndegree\\nor above18/endash.case24\\n50+\\n25/endash.case49Female\\nAsian\\nMale\\nHigh\\nHighest14.3×\\nlikelihood for \\nlow-wage \\nworkers to be \\naffected than \\nhighest-wage \\nworkers\\n1.7×\\nmore likely1.4×\\nmore likely\\n1.5×\\nmore likely\\n1.1×\\nmore likely\\nBlack\\nWhiteBelow\\nbachelor’s\\ndegree\\n/one.numrAverage national transition rate = 7.5%, calculated as total estimated transitions by 2030 divided by total employment in 2022.\\n/two.numrWe split occupations into quintiles according to their wage distributions.

Preparing for the \\nfuture of work\\nAs automation and other structural trends continue to raise demand for some occupations and \\nlower it for others, more turbulence could lie ahead. The Great Attrition caught many employers \\nby surprise. But mobility can be a healthy dynamic if it’s fueled by growth and leads people to \\nbetter matches where they can realize their potential. \\nLeaders in the business, policy, and education domains can prepare for what comes next by \\nkeeping employees engaged, helping them add more advanced skills, making training widely \\navailable, and bringing more people off the sidelines and into the workforce. Instead of watching \\npeople drop out of the workforce from discouragement, stakeholders will need to help midcareer \\nworkers reinvent themselves and pull in more of the people who are currently on the sidelines. \\nThe nation needs clear pathways for people to enter roles that are critical to its priorities, such as \\nhealthcare and skilled trades involved in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. \\nWhile many new initiatives have gotten under way to help workers add new skills and change \\ncareer paths, this is a moment to double down on what works and commit to creating a more \\ninclusive future with greater opportunities for a bigger slice of the workforce. \\n72 Human capital at work: The value of experience, McKinsey Global Institute, June 2022.\\n73 Ibid.The workplace plays a powerful role in \\ndeveloping the nation’s human capital\\nWhile much of the debate over the future of work focuses on the need for large-scale training \\nprograms, a great deal of skills development happens day-to-day on the job. Previous MGI \\nresearch on human capital examined the job moves made by millions of workers over a decade \\nand found that work experience contributes 40 percent of the average individual’s lifetime \\nearnings in the United States. Skills learned on the job are an even bigger determinant for people \\nwith lower educational credentials who start out in lower-wage work.72 \\nMGI’s research showed that almost one-third of US workers are on a path to move into higher \\nearning brackets, and amassing work experience in an effective way seems to be their key \\nto upward mobility. Each job move typically increased wages—and the bolder the move, the \\nbigger the boost. Companies with the strongest organizational health, those that offer more \\ncoaching and training for their employees, and those that provide more opportunities for internal \\nadvancement seem to help increase lifetime earnings.73 \\nMost employers can benefit from expanding the lens through which they evaluate candidates. \\nInstead of insisting on prior experience that best matches the responsibilities in an open role, \\norganizations can shift toward evaluating candidates on their capacity to learn, their intrinsic \\ncapabilities, and their transferable skills. This requires removing biases that pigeonhole people \\ninto the roles they are already performing. In our sample, more than half of all role moves \\nundertaken by individuals involved a substantial share of new skills, which implies that most \\npeople are capable of learning and doing more than they are doing today. Employers can benefit \\nfrom being more open to hiring candidates who have taken unconventional career paths.\\n53 McKinsey Global Institute | Generative AI and the future of work in America', metadata={'source': 'generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america-vf1.pdf', 'page': 60}), Document(page_content='Capturing the productivity potential of automation, including \\ngenerative AI, requires changing the way people work\\n74 Rekindling US productivity for a new era, McKinsey Global Institute, February 2023.\\n75 Erik Brynjolfsson, Daniel Rock, and Chad Syverson, The productivity J-curve: How intangibles complement general-purpose \\ntechnologies, NBER working paper number 25148, October 2018.The United States urgently needs to jump-start its flagging productivity growth, which has been \\na lackluster 1.4 percent since 2005.

Filling the jobs with rising demand may require companies to recruit from \\ndifferent talent pools—and it creates an opportunity to engage underrepresented groups.76 One \\nway to do this is creating new options for work that meet the needs of workers, whether that \\nmeans offering more flexible or part-time roles or hiring freelancers for appropriate tasks.\\nRemove unnecessary credential requirements\\nWe estimate that workers without four-year college degrees will face 75 percent of all job \\ntransitions that could occur by 2030. Many of these workers have what it takes to perform \\nhigher-wage jobs, but they are often passed over. In fact, Americans without bachelor’s \\ndegrees tend to have lower labor participation overall (58 percent versus 73 percent for college \\ngraduates), perhaps due in part to discouragement over what kinds of roles they can land. This is \\nan enormous population; almost 37 percent of Americans over age 25 have a high school diploma \\nor less. An additional 15 percent attended college but did not earn degrees.77 \\nTo help displaced workers find new career paths, more employers will need to begin looking \\nbeyond educational credentials to consider candidates’ transferable skills, mindset, and \\npotential. Companies such as IBM and Hilton are among many that are no longer requiring four-\\nyear degrees during hiring.

But \\nindividual employers cannot solve this issue on a large enough scale to move the needle on \\nwomen’s labor force participation. Efforts to secure federal funding for universal childcare \\nhave not come to fruition, but some individual cities and states are acting on their own.82 \\n56 McKinsey Global Institute | Generative AI and the future of work in America', metadata={'source': 'generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america-vf1.pdf', 'page': 63}), Document(page_content='The US infrastructure law, which requires private companies receiving contracts to provide \\nchildcare for their workers, helps to address childcare gaps and increase the low share of \\nconstruction workers who are women; this could provide a useful template.

But as \\npandemic-related health concerns ease and remote work becomes more accepted, this trend \\ncould reverse to some degree. More Americans will need to work longer to shore up their \\nfinances, given the decline of defined-benefit pension plans.

It will take coalitions of employers, educational institutions, \\nnonprofits, labor unions, and industry groups to tackle this challenge. \\n —Pre-college students.  Initiatives in schools can prepare tomorrow’s workforce for the \\nscience, technology, healthcare, and engineering jobs of the future. These can include \\nextracurricular activities and external competitions to encourage early engagement. For \\nexample, Million Girls Moonshot runs after-school activities and summer programs to inspire \\nand prepare more girls to pursue studies and careers in STEM. \\n —College students.  Many companies are teaming up with universities and community \\ncolleges to build highly targeted vocational pipelines and academic programs in areas of \\nhigh demand.91 Educational institutions can shape curricula toward skills and growing local \\nindustries, while companies can offer hands-on experience and immediate employment after \\nstudents complete their programs. With guidance from nonprofits and industry advisers, the \\nCity University of New York, for example, has been revising its curriculum in data analytics \\nand cybersecurity to prepare students to better meet labor demand.92 Looking beyond \\nindividual programming choices, the United States also needs to tackle some broader \\nstructural issues, including access to education as well as rising costs and debt burdens. In \\naddition, institutions need to do more to boost completion rates: only about 60 percent of \\nstudents who start a four-year program obtain a bachelor’s degree, and about 30 percent of \\nthose who pursue a certificate or associate degree actually earn those credentials.93 \\n —Unemployed individuals.  Organizations can build out training programs and pathways \\nto pull the unemployed into high-demand lines of work. For example, a nonprofit initiative \\ncalled Generation, founded by organizations including McKinsey, targets unemployed youth \\nworldwide. The program works with employers to identify the essential skills new employees \\nneed, then distills those skills into short-term four- to 12-week technical training courses, \\naccompanied by mentorship and placement services with partnering employers.94 \\n —Displaced workers.  In the years ahead, millions of midcareer workers will need to leave \\ndeclining occupations and enter new arenas. Workers will need to be adaptable and rise to \\nthe challenge of acquiring new skills. Companies can recruit from specific industries that \\nare shrinking, particularly if they map out which skills are transferable, and hire and train \\npeople with potential. They can also invest in learning programs to help their own workers \\nmake internal transfers into growing roles. With labor in shorter supply, companies will not \\nonly need to attract new talent. They will also need to focus on retention by keeping current \\nworkers engaged. Some attrition is to be expected, but employers cannot afford excessive \\nturnover and the loss of too much experience and institutional knowledge. Workers value \\nflexibility and a positive experience with their managers and teams more than ever—and they \\nare demanding more from their employers. \\n91 David Tobenkin, “Employers partner with community colleges to fill the talent pipeline,” SHRM, November 2021; and Olivia \\nSanchez, “Business partnerships with community colleges help funnel workers into better jobs,” Hechinger Report, July \\n2021.\\n92 Lilah Burke, “An industry-aligned education,” Inside Higher Ed, December 13, 2019.\\n93 “Increase completion and reduce inequities,” in The future of undergraduate education, the future of America, Commission \\non the Future of Undergraduate Education, American Academy of Arts & Sciences, November 2017.\\n94 See generation.org.Workers value flexibility and a \\npositive experience with their \\nmanagers and teams more than ever.\\n59 McKinsey Global Institute | Generative AI and the future of work in America', metadata={'source': 'generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america-vf1.pdf', 'page': 66}), Document(page_content='Retention will also matter more than ever. Employers can use what they learned from the \\npandemic to keep their workforces more engaged. In a McKinsey survey, employees cited not \\nfeeling valued by their organizations or their managers as primary reasons for quitting. Those \\nwho identified as non-White or multiracial were more likely than their White counterparts to say \\nthey had left companies because they didn’t feel they belonged. Employers have learned that \\nemployees want meaningful work, job flexibility and autonomy, connection, and opportunities \\nto learn and advance. Part of keeping them involves removing toxic managers in favor of those \\nwho motivate and inspire; aligning benefits with employee priorities; strengthening the sense of \\ncommunity; and creating career paths and development opportunities.95 \\nWhere it’s feasible, employers could consider hybrid work models as the rule and not the \\nexception. This could include both work-from-home accommodations and flexible working hours. \\nThis is easier in occupations with clearer productivity measures. As the pandemic demonstrated, \\nhybrid models help sustain productivity in the face of disruptive events; they can also help \\nemployees balance their work and personal lives. If flexibility is offered universally, but with \\nsome clear structures and policies in place, it can be a powerful source of employee satisfaction \\nand loyalty.96 \\nOffering existing employees learning opportunities and a clear path toward moving into new roles \\ncan reduce attrition—a major cost and a perennial headache in industries such as hospitality and \\nretail. Walmart’s Live Better U, for example, offers employees the chance to add skills for future \\nroles (or even to stay in their current roles); this program covers the full cost of tuition and books \\nfor those pursuing college degrees.\\nCompanies can also think more broadly about where their workforce is located. Rural and low-\\ngrowth areas have lagged behind the national average in employment growth and recovery. \\nBut remote work presents opportunities for non-urban areas to draw consumers and workers. \\nNot only can rural areas thrive and become more attractive to workers, but they may invest \\nin becoming centers for growing areas of demand such as warehousing and automation.97 \\nSome low-growth and rural areas have been offering financial incentives such as paying \\neligible workers to relocate. Other programs offer to reimburse moving expenses, provide free \\nrecreational services, or host coworking spaces. \\nSome people look at the spread of automation with a sense of foreboding about what it will mean \\nfor livelihoods. The good news is that the United States will likely have more jobs in the future, \\nand they will be higher-paying positions on average. But helping people in low-wage, shrinking \\nroles add the skills they need to move into growing jobs will require significant effort. In addition, \\nemployers will need to redesign many jobs and make them more fulfilling, and workers will need \\nto adapt as technology changes the nature of what they do.  \\nThe US labor market is proving itself to be resilient, which bodes well for the nation’s ability to \\nhandle the churn and change that the next several years may bring. Employers feel a new sense \\nof urgency, not only about their own workforce needs but also about what lies ahead for the US \\neconomy. This is a moment when smart policy can make a difference—and when companies can \\nstep up and lead in positioning people and communities for success. \\n95 Aaron De Smet, Bonnie Dowling, Marino Mugayar-Baldocchi, and Bill Schaninger, “‘Great Attrition’ or ‘Great Attraction’?

In this report, our analysis focuses on 2022–30, and all the driver \\nmodels have been updated accordingly. Additionally, we have updated two of our trends to \\nincorporate developments that have gained momentum in the United States, as follows:\\n —The push to achieve net-zero emissions:  The United States has made a formal international \\ncommitment to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero by 2050 at the latest. We \\nexamined the impact of this move on jobs using a scenario-based analysis drawing on the \\napproach used by the Network for Greening the Financial System. We built on previous \\nMcKinsey research assessing the impact at a global level to analyze the specific implications \\nfor the United States, adding sectoral and occupational dimensions to the analysis.99 \\nThis net-zero analysis assumes that current supply chain composition remains the same by \\n2030. We consider the impact of the United States meeting its own emissions targets as well \\nas its role in meeting global demand for products. Jobs gained and lost are allocated as per \\nthe occupational mix of 2022. We consider job losses and gains directly associated with the \\ntransition and do not include other macroeconomic forces like population and income growth. \\nIn addition to creating a scenario, we consulted other estimates of the net-zero transition’s \\nimpact on jobs by 2030. These range from job gains of 178,000 (Decarb America) and \\n300,000 to 600,000 (Princeton Net-Zero America) to gains of 6.5 million (World Resources \\nInstitute 2035 estimate).100 Estimates vary depending on assumptions about productivity and \\nthe US role in the global energy market, plus whether direct and indirect impacts are included.\\n —Infrastructure spending:  The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, signed in 2021, allocated \\n$1.2 trillion in federal funding toward a variety of projects nationwide.101 To reflect the \\nimpact of additional spending on jobs creation mandated by the legislation, we updated our \\ninfrastructure driver by incorporating construction-sector value-added estimates inclusive of \\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law allocations through 2030. \\nWe use the following data sources and methodology: \\n —Labor force data:  The Current Population Survey (CPS), conducted by the US Census Bureau \\nfor the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), is the primary data source for workforce statistics \\nin this report.

The numbers are \\nthen proportionately scaled to CPS total employment to enable the inclusion of farm and self-\\nemployed workforce statistics. We apply annual growth rates from BLS 2021–31 projections \\nto the 2022 baseline to estimate 2030 employment levels. \\n —Automation:  To determine the potential impact of automation in the workplace, we use data \\npublished by the BLS and O*NET to break down some 850 occupations into about 2,100 \\nconstituent activities. Each activity is matched to one or more of 18 capabilities to assess \\nthe potential for a known technology to handle this work. In addition to looking at what is \\npossible, we also consider what is feasible by assessing the solution development timeline, \\nthe economics of adoption versus paying wages, and the time required for adoption and \\ndeployment. We use the scenario inclusive of the impact of generative AI.\\n —Impact of automation on productivity: We used GDP per full-time employee (FTE) as the \\nmeasure of productivity. We calculated automation output under different scenarios by \\nmultiplying the projected number of FTEs by the estimated automation adoption rate. To \\nmaintain consistency with other data sources, we made several additional assumptions. We \\nconsidered only job activities that are available and well defined as of the date of this report. \\nAlso, to be conservative, we assumed automation has a labor substitution effect but no \\nother performance gains. Finally, we created two scenarios: a pessimistic scenario in which \\nlabor displaced by automation rejoins the workforce at 2022 productivity levels, and a more \\noptimistic scenario in which they rejoin at 2030 productivity levels, net of automation. In both \\nscenarios, we have incorporated labor displaced rejoining in line with the expected 2030 Box 2\\nA note on terminology \\nWe use the term “occupational shifts” to mean declines in employment in specific \\noccupations between 2019 and 2022. (We do not include gains in this calculation to avoid \\ndouble counting.) \\nSince the number of total workers grew over this period, losses in some occupations \\nwere offset or more than offset by gains in other occupations. We interpret these losses \\nor declines that are offset by other gains as the effect of workers switching from one \\ntype of work to another. From the gross declines in each occupation, we also reduced a \\nproportional share of total retirements. We calculated this by taking the number of total \\nretirements from the BLS and allocating a share to each occupation according to its \\nproportion of workers ages 65 and over. \\nHowever, we do not know exactly how many individuals moved from one occupation \\nto another or if they made multiple moves; for that reason, we refer to the number of \\noccupational shifts that occurred during this period rather than specifying the number of \\nworkers making those changes. \\nMuch of our analysis looks at occupational categories, using BLS groupings. Each of \\nthose categories contains multiple occupations. A move from one occupation to another \\nwithin the same category is counted as a shift (in historical context) or a transition (in the \\ncontext of future projections). Within any given category, some individual occupations \\nmay experience declines while others increase. The results by category reflect their \\noffsetting effects.\\n64 McKinsey Global Institute | Generative AI and the future of work in America', metadata={'source': 'generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america-vf1.pdf', 'page': 71}), Document(page_content='occupational mix. We also assumed that additional output from automation will not decrease, \\neven if the total number of FTEs declines as a result of demographic changes. Under the \\nassumptions outlined above, we calculated the GDP impact of automation adoption by \\ncountry as follows:\\nAdditional GDP impact of automation = FTE impact of automation X productivity2022\\nThe additional GDP impact of automation is then added to 2022 GDP to estimate the productivity \\nimpact of automation.\\n —Long-term labor market trends:  We estimate labor demand factoring in seven \\nmacroeconomic catalysts: rising incomes, healthcare and aging, technological innovation, \\ninfrastructure investment, education, the marketization of unpaid work, and the push to reach \\nnet-zero emissions across the economy. We capture direct and indirect jobs that could be \\ncreated or lost from each catalyst by leveraging job multipliers from input-output tables.\\n —Trends accelerated by COVID-19:  We incorporated several broad trends accelerated by \\nthe pandemic that may influence labor demand and jobs in the economy through 2030, \\nincluding increased remote work and virtual meetings and the shift to e-commerce and other \\nvirtual transactions. \\n —Skills demand and transitions:  We look at 25 workforce skills that fall into five broad \\ncategories: physical and manual, basic cognitive, higher cognitive, social and emotional, and \\ntechnological. The number of hours that workers spend performing specific work activities \\nare then mapped to each skill. Since one-to-one mapping of skills and activities undercounts \\ndigital skills, we correct this by reallocating a portion of hours from activities requiring non-\\ntechnological skills to those requiring basic digital skills.\\n65 McKinsey Global Institute | Generative AI and the future of work in America', metadata={'source': 'generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america-vf1.pdf', 'page': 72}), Document(page_content='© Eclipse Images / Getty', metadata={'source': 'generative-ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-america-vf1.pdf', 'page': 73}), Document(page_content='Acknowledgments\\nThis report is the product of a collaboration between the McKinsey Global Institute and the \\nMcKinsey Center for Government. \\nThe research was led by Kweilin Ellingrud, an MGI director based in Minneapolis; Saurabh \\nSanghvi, a McKinsey partner based in Silicon Valley; Gurneet Singh Dandona, an MGI senior \\nexpert and associate partner based in New York; Anu Madgavkar, an MGI partner based in New \\nJersey; Michael Chui, an MGI partner based in San Francisco; and Olivia White, an MGI director in \\nSan Francisco.

It states that a significant portion of the workforce possesses skills gained through experience rather than formal education, with 60 percent of U.S. workers not having four-year college degrees. Efforts like the \"Tear the Paper Ceiling\" initiative are highlighted for supporting workers with experience over degrees, indicating a growing awareness and potential shift among employers towards more inclusive hiring practices. Furthermore, employers are encouraged to recruit from typically overlooked populations and to focus on skills and abilities in their hiring processes​​​​.This change aligns with the broader trend of employers seeking to hire for skills and competencies, possibly as a response to the changes brought about by technologies like generative AI. The document doesn't explicitly state how generative AI will change the relative importance of credentials and experience, but the context suggests that the advancement of AI could contribute to a hiring landscape that favors demonstrable skills and practical experience, potentially at the expense of traditional credentials."],"metadata":{"id":"bRYwhFtLSG1X"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Question 2: Agents, Tools and Memory\n","\n","Consider the following series of four questions by a customer with an AI system.\n","\n","· Who reached the peak of Mount Everest first?\n","\n","· When was that?\n","\n","· What is the typical pace of a climber trying to scale the peak in feet per hour? · If one could hold that steady space, how long would it take to scale the peak?\n","\n","Now answer the following questions.\n","\n","1.

The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point. Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 8+1⁄2 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the \"standard route\") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. As of November 2022, 310 people have died on Everest. Over 200 bodies remain on the mountain and have not been removed due to the dangerous conditions.The first recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made by British mountaineers. As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time, the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side. After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached 7,000 m (22,970 ft) on the North Col, the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to 8,320 m (27,300 ft), marking the first time a human had climbed above 8,000 m (26,247 ft). The 1924 expedition resulted in one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day: George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to whether they were the first to reach the top. Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary made the first documented ascent of Everest in 1953, using the southeast ridge route. Norgay had reached 8,595 m (28,199 ft) the previous year as a member of the 1952 Swiss expedition. The Chinese mountaineering team of Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo, and Qu Yinhua made the first reported ascent of the peak from the north ridge on 25 May 1960.\n","\n","Page: List of people who died climbing Mount Everest\n","Summary: Over 330 people have died attempting to reach the summit of Mount Everest which, at 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 8+1⁄2 in), is Earth's highest mountain and a particularly desirable peak for mountaineers. This makes it the mountain with the most deaths, although it does not have the highest death rate. The most recent years without known deaths on the mountain are 1977, in which only two people reached the summit, and 2020, when permits were suspended by Nepal because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Deaths have been attributed to avalanches, falls, serac collapse, exposure, frostbite, or health problems related to conditions on the mountain. Not all bodies have been located, so details on those deaths are not available.\n","The upper reaches of the mountain are in the death zone, a mountaineering term for altitudes above a certain point – around 8,000 m (26,000 ft), or less than 356 millibars (5.16 psi) of atmospheric pressure – where the oxygen pressure level is not sufficient to sustain human life. Many deaths in high-altitude mountaineering have been caused by the effects of the death zone, either directly (loss of vital functions) or indirectly (unwise decisions made under stress or physical weakening leading to accidents). In the death zone, the human body cannot acclimatize, as it uses oxygen faster than it can be replenished. An extended stay in the zone without supplementary oxygen will result in deterioration of bodily functions, loss of consciousness, and death.\n","\n","Page: 1996 Mount Everest disaster\n","Summary: The 1996 Mount Everest disaster occurred on 10–11 May 1996 when eight climbers caught in a blizzard died on Mount Everest while attempting to descend from the summit.

There are daily flights between Lukla and Kathmandu during daylight hours in good weather. Although the flying distance is short, rain commonly occurs in Lukla while the sun is shining brightly in Kathmandu. High winds, cloud cover, and changing visibility often mean flights can be delayed or the airport closed.

They were part of the ninth British expedition to Everest, led by John Hunt. From 1985 to 1988 he served as New Zealand's High Commissioner to India and Bangladesh and concurrently as Ambassador to Nepal.\n","Hillary became interested in mountaineering while in secondary school. He made his first major climb in 1939, reaching the summit of Mount Ollivier. He served in the Royal New Zealand Air Force as a navigator during World War II and was wounded in an accident. Prior to the Everest expedition, Hillary had been part of the British reconnaissance expedition to the mountain in 1951 as well as an unsuccessful attempt to climb Cho Oyu in 1952.\n","As part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition he reached the South Pole overland in 1958.

It originated from English claims to the French throne. The war grew into a broader power struggle involving factions from across Western Europe, fueled by emerging nationalism on both sides. The periodization of the war takes place over 116 years, wherein the war was interrupted by several years of truces.\n","The Hundred Years' War was a significant conflict in the Middle Ages. During the war, five generations of kings from two rival dynasties fought for the throne of France, which was then the dominant kingdom in Western Europe. The war had a lasting effect on European history. Both sides produced innovations in military technology and tactics, including professional standing armies and artillery, that permanently changed warfare in Europe; chivalry, which reached its height during the conflict, subsequently declined. Stronger national identities took root in both countries, which became more centralised and gradually rose as global powers.The term \"Hundred Years' War\" was adopted by later historians as a historiographical periodisation to encompass related conflicts, constructing the longest military conflict in European history. The war is commonly divided into three phases separated by truces: the Edwardian War (1337–1360), the Caroline War (1369–1389), and the Lancastrian War (1415–1453). Each side drew many allies into the conflict, with English forces initially prevailing; however, the French forces under the House of Valois ultimately retained control over the Kingdom of France. The French and English monarchies, previously intertwined, thereafter remained separate.\n","\n","Page: Hundred Years' War, 1415–1453\n","Summary: The Lancastrian War was the third and final phase of the Hundred Years' War between England and France. It lasted from 1415, when King Henry V of England invaded Normandy, to 1453, when the English lost Bordeaux. It followed a long period of peace from the end of the Caroline War in 1389. The phase is named after the House of Lancaster, the ruling house of the Kingdom of England, to which Henry V belonged.\n","The first half of this phase of the war was dominated by the Kingdom of England. Initial English successes, notably at the famous Battle of Agincourt, coupled with divisions among the French ruling class, allowed the English to gain control of large parts of France. In 1420, the Treaty of Troyes was signed, by which the English king married the French princess Catherine and was made regent of the kingdom and heir to the throne of France. A victory on paper was thus achieved by the English, with their claims now having legal standing. Some of the French nobility refused to recognise the agreement, however, and so military subjugation was still necessary to enforce its provisions. King Henry V and, after his death, his brother John, Duke of Bedford, brought the English to the height of their power in France, with an English king crowned in Paris.\n","The second half of this phase of the war was dominated by the Kingdom of France. French forces counterattacked, inspired by Joan of Arc, La Hire and the Count of Dunois, and aided by the English loss of its main allies, the Dukes of Burgundy and Brittany. Charles VII of France was crowned in Notre-Dame de Reims in 1429, and from then a slow but steady reconquest of English-held French territories ensued. Ultimately the English would be expelled from France and lose all of their continental territories, except the Pale of Calais (which would be re-captured by the French in 1558).\n","The Battle of Castillon (1453) was the final action of the Hundred Years' War, but France and England remained formally at war until the Treaty of Picquigny in 1475. English, and later British monarchs would continue to nominally claim the French throne until 1801, though they would never agai\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I now know the final answer\n","Final Answer: The First Hundred Year War was fought from 1337 to 1453 between the kingdoms of England and France.\u001b[0m\n","\n","\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\n","\n","\n","\u001b[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I need to find out when the war was fought and when India got independence\n","Action: Wikipedia\n","Action Input: First war of Indian independence\u001b[0m"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/wikipedia/wikipedia.py:389: GuessedAtParserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system (\"lxml\").

The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 mi (64 km) northeast of Delhi. It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east. The rebellion posed a military threat to British power in that region, and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859. \n","The name of the revolt is contested, and it is variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence.The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, as well as scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule. Many Indians rose against the British; however, many also fought for the British, and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule. Violence, which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty, was inflicted on both sides, on British officers, and civilians, including women and children, by the rebels, and on the rebels, and their supporters, including sometimes entire villages, by British reprisals; the cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation.After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut, the rebels quickly reached Delhi, whose 81-year-old Mughal ruler, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was declared the Emperor of Hindustan. Soon, the rebels had captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh (Oudh). The East India Company's response came rapidly as well. With help from reinforcements, Kanpur was retaken by mid-July 1857, and Delhi by the end of September. However, it then took the remainder of 1857 and the better part of 1858 for the rebellion to be suppressed in Jhansi, Lucknow, and especially the Awadh countryside. Other regions of Company-controlled India—Bengal province, the Bombay Presidency, and the Madras Presidency—remained largely calm. In the Punjab, the Sikh princes crucially helped the British by providing both soldiers and support. The large princely states, Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore, and Kashmir, as well as the smaller ones of Rajputana, did not join the rebellion, serving the British, in the Governor-General Lord Canning's words, as \"breakwaters in a storm\".In some regions, most notably in Awadh, the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against British oppression. However, the rebel leaders proclaimed no articles of faith that presaged a new political system. Even so, the rebellion proved to be an important watershed in Indian and British Empire history. It led to the dissolution of the East India Company, and forced the British to reorganize the army, the financial system, and the administration in India, through passage of the Government of India Act 1858. India was thereafter administered directly by the British government in the new British Raj. On 1 November 1858, Queen Victoria issued a proclamation to Indians, which while lacking the authority of a constitutional provision, promised rights similar to those of other British subjects. In the following decades, when admission to these rights was not always forthcoming, Indians were to pointedly refer to the Queen's proclamation in growing avowals of a new nationalism.\n","\n","Page: Names of the Indian Rebellion of 1857\n","Summary: The Indian Rebellion o\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I need to find out when India got independence\n","Action: Wikipedia\n","Action Input: Indian independence\u001b[0m"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/wikipedia/wikipedia.py:389: GuessedAtParserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system (\"lxml\").

It lasted until 1947.\n","The first nationalistic revolutionary movement for Indian independence emerged from Bengal. It later took root in the newly formed Indian National Congress with prominent moderate leaders seeking the right to appear for Indian Civil Service examinations in British India, as well as more economic rights for natives. The first half of the 20th century saw a more radical approach towards self-rule.\n","The stages of the independence struggle in the 1920s were characterized by the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and Congress' adoption of Gandhi's policy of non-violence and civil disobedience. Some of the leading followers of Gandhi's ideology were Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, Vallabhbhai Patel, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Maulana Azad, and others. Intellectuals such as Rabindranath Tagore, Subramania Bharati, and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay spread patriotic awareness. Female leaders like Sarojini Naidu, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, Pritilata Waddedar, and Kasturba Gandhi promoted the emancipation of Indian women and their participation in the freedom struggle.\n","Few leaders followed a more violent approach, which became especially popular after the Rowlatt Act, which permitted indefinite detention. The Act sparked protests across India, especially in the Punjab province, where they were violently suppressed in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.\n","The Indian independence movement was in constant ideological evolution. Essentially anti-colonial, it was supplemented by visions of independent, economic development with a secular, democratic, republican, and civil-libertarian political structure. After the 1930s, the movement took on a strong socialist orientation. It culminated in the Indian Independence Act 1947, which ended Crown suzerainty and partitioned British Raj into Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan.\n","India remained a Crown Dominion until 26 January 1950, when the Constitution of India established the Republic of India. Pakistan remained a dominion until 1956 when it adopted its first constitution.

The cause of the war was the dispute over whether slavery would be permitted to expand into the western territories, leading to more slave states, or be prevented from doing so, which many believed would place slavery on a course of ultimate extinction.\n","Decades of political controversy over slavery were brought to a head by the victory in the 1860 U.S. presidential election of Abraham Lincoln, who opposed slavery's expansion into the western territories. Seven southern slave states responded to Lincoln's victory by seceding from the United States and forming the Confederacy. The Confederacy seized U.S. forts and other federal assets within their borders. Four more southern states seceded after the war began and, led by Confederate President Jefferson Davis, the Confederacy asserted control over about a third of the U.S. population in eleven states. Four years of intense combat, mostly in the South, ensued.\n","During 1861–1862 in the Western Theater, the Union made significant permanent gains—though in the Eastern Theater the conflict was inconclusive. The abolition of slavery became a Union war goal on January 1, 1863, when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared all slaves in rebel states to be free, which applied to more than 3.5 million of the 4 million enslaved people in the country. To the west, the Union first destroyed the Confederacy's river navy by the summer of 1862, then much of its western armies, and later seized New Orleans. The successful 1863 Union siege of Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River. In 1863, Confederate General Robert E. Lee's incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg. Western successes led to General Ulysses S. Grant's command of all Union armies in 1864. Inflicting an ever-tightening naval blockade of Confederate ports, the Union marshaled resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions. This led to the fall of Atlanta in 1864 to Union General William Tecumseh Sherman, followed by his March to the Sea. The last significant battles raged around the ten-month Siege of Petersburg, gateway to the Confederate capital of Richmond. The Confederates abandoned Richmond, and on April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered to Grant following the Battle of Appomattox Court House, setting in motion the end of the war.\n","A wave of Confederate surrenders followed. On April 14, just five days after Lee's surrender, Lincoln was assassinated. On May 26, the last military department of the Confederacy, the Department of the Trans-Mississippi, effectively surrendered, but the conclusion of the American Civil War lacks a clear end date, and Appomattox is often symbolically referred to. Small confederate ground forces continued surrendering past the May 26 surrender date until June 23. By the end of the war, much of the South's infrastructure was destroyed, especially its railroads. The Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and four million enslaved black people were freed. The war-torn nation then entered the Reconstruction era in an attempt to rebuild the country, bring the former Confederate states back into the United States, and grant civil rights to freed slaves.\n","The Civil War is one of the most extensively studied and written about episodes in U.S. history. It remains the subject of cultural and historiographical debate. Of particular interest is the persisting myth of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. The American Civil War was among the first wars to use industrial warfare. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, the ironclad warship, and mass-produced weapons were all widely used during the war.

One of these was a British-led force with units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick, and Nassau, under the command of the Duke of Wellington (often referred to as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army). The other comprised three corps of the Prussian army under Field Marshal von Blücher (the fourth corps of this army fought at the Battle of Wavre on the same day). The battle was known contemporarily as the Battle of Mont Saint-Jean in France or La Belle Alliance (\"the Beautiful Alliance\") in Prussia.Upon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815 (beginning the Hundred Days), many states that had previously opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and hurriedly mobilised their armies. Wellington's and Blücher's armies were cantoned close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately, before they could link up and invade France with other members of the coalition.\n","On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the Battle of Ligny with his main force, while a small portion of the French army contested the Battle of Quatre Bras to prevent the Anglo-allied army from reinforcing the Prussians.

Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of 18 June and almost lost the battle, but was eventually aided by the progressively arriving 50,000 Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening, Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the Imperial Guard. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army repulsed the Imperial Guard, and the French army was routed.\n","Waterloo was the decisive engagement of the Waterloo campaign and Napoleon's last. It was also the second bloodiest single day battle of the Napoleonic Wars, after Borodino. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\".

The dynasty was preceded by the short-lived Qin dynasty (221–207 BC) and a warring interregnum known as the Chu–Han contention (206–202 BC), and it was succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 AD). The dynasty was briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (9–23 AD) established by usurping regent Wang Mang, and is thus separated into two periods—the Western Han (202 BC – 9 AD) and the Eastern Han (25–220 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history, and it has influenced the identity of the Chinese civilization ever since. Modern China's majority ethnic group refer to themselves as the \"Han people\" or \"Han Chinese\". The spoken Sinitic language and written Chinese are referred to respectively as the \"Han language\" and \"Han characters\".The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society. He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class. The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government called commanderies, as well as a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms. These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence, particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States. From the reign of Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BC) onward, the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics, synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu. This policy endured until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912.\n","The Han dynasty saw an age of economic prosperity and witnessed a significant growth of the money economy first established during the Zhou dynasty (c. 1050–256 BC). The coinage minted by the central government in 119 BC remained the standard coinage of China until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). The period saw a number of limited institutional innovations. To finance its military campaigns and the settlement of newly conquered frontier territories, the Han government nationalized the private salt and iron industries in 117 BC, though these government monopolies were later repealed during the Eastern Han dynasty. Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances, including the process of papermaking, the nautical steering ship rudder, the use of negative numbers in mathematics, the raised-relief map, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere for astronomy, and a seismometer employing an inverted pendulum that could be used to discern the cardinal direction of distant earthquakes.\n","The Han dynasty had many conflicts with the Xiongnu, a nomadic confederation centered in the eastern Eurasian steppe. The Xiongnu defeated the Han in 200 BC, prompting the Han to appease the Xiongnu with a policy of marriage alliance and payments of tribute, though the Xiongnu continued to raid the Han's northern borders. Han policy changed in 133 BC, under Emperor Wu, when Han forces began a series of military campaigns to quell the Xiongnu. The Han ultimately defeated the Xiongnu, forcing them to accept vassal status as Han tributaries, and the Xiongnu confederation fragmented. The Han conquered the Hexi Corridor and Inner Asian territory of the Tarim Basin from the Xiongnu, helping to establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road. The lands north of the Han's borders were later overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful conquests in the south, annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC. He further expanded Han territory into the northern Korean Peninsula, where Han forces conquered Gojoseon and established the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies in 108 BC.

Republicans were loyal to the left-leaning Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic, and consisted of various socialist, communist, separatist, anarchist, and republican parties, some of which had opposed the government in the pre-war period. The opposing Nationalists were an alliance of Falangists, monarchists, conservatives, and traditionalists led by a military junta among whom General Francisco Franco quickly achieved a preponderant role. Due to the international political climate at the time, the war had many facets and was variously viewed as class struggle, a religious struggle, a struggle between dictatorship and republican democracy, between revolution and counterrevolution, and between fascism and communism. According to Claude Bowers, U.S. ambassador to Spain during the war, it was the \"dress rehearsal\" for World War II. The Nationalists won the war, which ended in early 1939, and ruled Spain until Franco's death in November 1975.\n","The war began after the partial failure of the coup d'état of July 1936 against the Republican government by a group of generals of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces, with General Emilio Mola as the primary planner and leader and having General José Sanjurjo as a figurehead. The government at the time was a coalition of Republicans, supported in the Cortes by communist and socialist parties, under the leadership of centre-left President Manuel Azaña. The Nationalist faction was supported by a number of conservative groups, including CEDA, monarchists, including both the opposing Alfonsists and the religious conservative Carlists, and the Falange Española de las JONS, a fascist political party. After the deaths of Sanjurjo, Emilio Mola and Manuel Goded Llopis, Franco emerged as the remaining leader of the Nationalist side.\n","The coup was supported by military units in Morocco, Pamplona, Burgos, Zaragoza, Valladolid, Cádiz, Córdoba, and Seville. However, rebelling units in almost all important cities—such as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao, and Málaga—did not gain control, and those cities remained under the control of the government. This left Spain militarily and politically divided. The Nationalists and the Republican government fought for control of the country. The Nationalist forces received munitions, soldiers, and air support from Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany and Portugal, while the Republican side received support from the Soviet Union and Mexico. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, continued to recognise the Republican government but followed an official policy of non-intervention. Despite this policy, tens of thousands of citizens from non-interventionist countries directly participated in the conflict. They fought mostly in the pro-Republican International Brigades, which also included several thousand exiles from pro-Nationalist regimes.\n","The Nationalists advanced from their strongholds in the south and west, capturing most of Spain's northern coastline in 1937. They also besieged Madrid and the area to its south and west for much of the war. After much of Catalonia was captured in 1938 and 1939, and Madrid cut off from Barcelona, the Republican military position became hopeless. Following the fall without resistance of Barcelona in January 1939, the Francoist regime was recognised by France and the United Kingdom in February 1939. On 5 March 1939, in response to an alleged increasing communist dominance of the republican government and the deteriorating military situation, Colonel Segismundo Casado led a military coup against the Republican government, with the intention of seeking peace with the Nationalists. These peace overtures, however, were rejected by Franco. Following internal conflict between Republican factions in Madrid in the same month, Franco enter\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I now know the general timeline of the Spanish Civil War and who was involved\n","Final Answer: The Spanish Civil War was fought from 1936 to 1939 between the Republicans and the Nationalists.

It originated from English claims to the French throne. The war grew into a broader power struggle involving factions from across Western Europe, fueled by emerging nationalism on both sides. The periodization of the war takes place over 116 years, wherein the war was interrupted by several years of truces.\n","The Hundred Years' War was a significant conflict in the Middle Ages. During the war, five generations of kings from two rival dynasties fought for the throne of France, which was then the dominant kingdom in Western Europe. The war had a lasting effect on European history. Both sides produced innovations in military technology and tactics, including professional standing armies and artillery, that permanently changed warfare in Europe; chivalry, which reached its height during the conflict, subsequently declined. Stronger national identities took root in both countries, which became more centralised and gradually rose as global powers.The term \"Hundred Years' War\" was adopted by later historians as a historiographical periodisation to encompass related conflicts, constructing the longest military conflict in European history. The war is commonly divided into three phases separated by truces: the Edwardian War (1337–1360), the Caroline War (1369–1389), and the Lancastrian War (1415–1453). Each side drew many allies into the conflict, with English forces initially prevailing; however, the French forces under the House of Valois ultimately retained control over the Kingdom of France. The French and English monarchies, previously intertwined, thereafter remained separate.\n","\n","Page: Hundred Years' War, 1415–1453\n","Summary: The Lancastrian War was the third and final phase of the Hundred Years' War between England and France. It lasted from 1415, when King Henry V of England invaded Normandy, to 1453, when the English lost Bordeaux. It followed a long period of peace from the end of the Caroline War in 1389. The phase is named after the House of Lancaster, the ruling house of the Kingdom of England, to which Henry V belonged.\n","The first half of this phase of the war was dominated by the Kingdom of England. Initial English successes, notably at the famous Battle of Agincourt, coupled with divisions among the French ruling class, allowed the English to gain control of large parts of France. In 1420, the Treaty of Troyes was signed, by which the English king married the French princess Catherine and was made regent of the kingdom and heir to the throne of France. A victory on paper was thus achieved by the English, with their claims now having legal standing. Some of the French nobility refused to recognise the agreement, however, and so military subjugation was still necessary to enforce its provisions. King Henry V and, after his death, his brother John, Duke of Bedford, brought the English to the height of their power in France, with an English king crowned in Paris.\n","The second half of this phase of the war was dominated by the Kingdom of France. French forces counterattacked, inspired by Joan of Arc, La Hire and the Count of Dunois, and aided by the English loss of its main allies, the Dukes of Burgundy and Brittany. Charles VII of France was crowned in Notre-Dame de Reims in 1429, and from then a slow but steady reconquest of English-held French territories ensued. Ultimately the English would be expelled from France and lose all of their continental territories, except the Pale of Calais (which would be re-captured by the French in 1558).\n","The Battle of Castillon (1453) was the final action of the Hundred Years' War, but France and England remained formally at war until the Treaty of Picquigny in 1475. English, and later British monarchs would continue to nominally claim the French throne until 1801, though they would never agai\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I now know the final answer\n","Final Answer: The First Hundred Year War was fought from 1337 to 1453 between the kingdoms of England and France.\u001b[0m\n","\n","\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\n","\n","\n","\u001b[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I need to find out when the war was fought and when India got independence\n","Action: Wikipedia\n","Action Input: First war of Indian independence\u001b[0m"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/wikipedia/wikipedia.py:389: GuessedAtParserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system (\"lxml\").

The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 mi (64 km) northeast of Delhi. It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east. The rebellion posed a military threat to British power in that region, and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859. \n","The name of the revolt is contested, and it is variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence.The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, as well as scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule. Many Indians rose against the British; however, many also fought for the British, and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule. Violence, which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty, was inflicted on both sides, on British officers, and civilians, including women and children, by the rebels, and on the rebels, and their supporters, including sometimes entire villages, by British reprisals; the cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation.After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut, the rebels quickly reached Delhi, whose 81-year-old Mughal ruler, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was declared the Emperor of Hindustan. Soon, the rebels had captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh (Oudh). The East India Company's response came rapidly as well. With help from reinforcements, Kanpur was retaken by mid-July 1857, and Delhi by the end of September. However, it then took the remainder of 1857 and the better part of 1858 for the rebellion to be suppressed in Jhansi, Lucknow, and especially the Awadh countryside. Other regions of Company-controlled India—Bengal province, the Bombay Presidency, and the Madras Presidency—remained largely calm. In the Punjab, the Sikh princes crucially helped the British by providing both soldiers and support. The large princely states, Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore, and Kashmir, as well as the smaller ones of Rajputana, did not join the rebellion, serving the British, in the Governor-General Lord Canning's words, as \"breakwaters in a storm\".In some regions, most notably in Awadh, the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against British oppression. However, the rebel leaders proclaimed no articles of faith that presaged a new political system. Even so, the rebellion proved to be an important watershed in Indian and British Empire history. It led to the dissolution of the East India Company, and forced the British to reorganize the army, the financial system, and the administration in India, through passage of the Government of India Act 1858. India was thereafter administered directly by the British government in the new British Raj. On 1 November 1858, Queen Victoria issued a proclamation to Indians, which while lacking the authority of a constitutional provision, promised rights similar to those of other British subjects. In the following decades, when admission to these rights was not always forthcoming, Indians were to pointedly refer to the Queen's proclamation in growing avowals of a new nationalism.\n","\n","Page: Names of the Indian Rebellion of 1857\n","Summary: The Indian Rebellion o\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I need to find out when India got independence\n","Action: Wikipedia\n","Action Input: Indian independence\u001b[0m"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/wikipedia/wikipedia.py:389: GuessedAtParserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system (\"lxml\").

Intellectuals such as Rabindranath Tagore, Subramania Bharati, and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay spread patriotic awareness.

The cause of the war was the dispute over whether slavery would be permitted to expand into the western territories, leading to more slave states, or be prevented from doing so, which many believed would place slavery on a course of ultimate extinction.\n","Decades of political controversy over slavery were brought to a head by the victory in the 1860 U.S. presidential election of Abraham Lincoln, who opposed slavery's expansion into the western territories. Seven southern slave states responded to Lincoln's victory by seceding from the United States and forming the Confederacy. The Confederacy seized U.S. forts and other federal assets within their borders. Four more southern states seceded after the war began and, led by Confederate President Jefferson Davis, the Confederacy asserted control over about a third of the U.S. population in eleven states. Four years of intense combat, mostly in the South, ensued.\n","During 1861–1862 in the Western Theater, the Union made significant permanent gains—though in the Eastern Theater the conflict was inconclusive. The abolition of slavery became a Union war goal on January 1, 1863, when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared all slaves in rebel states to be free, which applied to more than 3.5 million of the 4 million enslaved people in the country. To the west, the Union first destroyed the Confederacy's river navy by the summer of 1862, then much of its western armies, and later seized New Orleans. The successful 1863 Union siege of Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River. In 1863, Confederate General Robert E. Lee's incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg. Western successes led to General Ulysses S. Grant's command of all Union armies in 1864. Inflicting an ever-tightening naval blockade of Confederate ports, the Union marshaled resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions. This led to the fall of Atlanta in 1864 to Union General William Tecumseh Sherman, followed by his March to the Sea. The last significant battles raged around the ten-month Siege of Petersburg, gateway to the Confederate capital of Richmond. The Confederates abandoned Richmond, and on April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered to Grant following the Battle of Appomattox Court House, setting in motion the end of the war.\n","A wave of Confederate surrenders followed. On April 14, just five days after Lee's surrender, Lincoln was assassinated. On May 26, the last military department of the Confederacy, the Department of the Trans-Mississippi, effectively surrendered, but the conclusion of the American Civil War lacks a clear end date, and Appomattox is often symbolically referred to. Small confederate ground forces continued surrendering past the May 26 surrender date until June 23. By the end of the war, much of the South's infrastructure was destroyed, especially its railroads. The Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and four million enslaved black people were freed. The war-torn nation then entered the Reconstruction era in an attempt to rebuild the country, bring the former Confederate states back into the United States, and grant civil rights to freed slaves.\n","The Civil War is one of the most extensively studied and written about episodes in U.S. history. It remains the subject of cultural and historiographical debate. Of particular interest is the persisting myth of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. The American Civil War was among the first wars to use industrial warfare. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, the ironclad warship, and mass-produced weapons were all widely used during the war.

A French army under the command of Napoleon was defeated by two armies of the Seventh Coalition. One of these was a British-led force with units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick, and Nassau, under the command of the Duke of Wellington (often referred to as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army). The other comprised three corps of the Prussian army under Field Marshal von Blücher (the fourth corps of this army fought at the Battle of Wavre on the same day). The battle was known contemporarily as the Battle of Mont Saint-Jean in France or La Belle Alliance (\"the Beautiful Alliance\") in Prussia.Upon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815 (beginning the Hundred Days), many states that had previously opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and hurriedly mobilised their armies. Wellington's and Blücher's armies were cantoned close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately, before they could link up and invade France with other members of the coalition.\n","On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the Battle of Ligny with his main force, while a small portion of the French army contested the Battle of Quatre Bras to prevent the Anglo-allied army from reinforcing the Prussians. The Anglo-allied army held their ground at Quatre Bras, and on the 17th, the Prussians withdrew from Ligny in good order, while Wellington then withdrew in parallel with the Prussians northward to Waterloo on 17 June. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate Battle of Wavre with the Prussian rear-guard on 18–19 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo.\n","Upon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the Mont-Saint-Jean escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of 18 June and almost lost the battle, but was eventually aided by the progressively arriving 50,000 Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening, Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the Imperial Guard.

The dynasty was preceded by the short-lived Qin dynasty (221–207 BC) and a warring interregnum known as the Chu–Han contention (206–202 BC), and it was succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 AD). The dynasty was briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (9–23 AD) established by usurping regent Wang Mang, and is thus separated into two periods—the Western Han (202 BC – 9 AD) and the Eastern Han (25–220 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history, and it has influenced the identity of the Chinese civilization ever since. Modern China's majority ethnic group refer to themselves as the \"Han people\" or \"Han Chinese\". The spoken Sinitic language and written Chinese are referred to respectively as the \"Han language\" and \"Han characters\".The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society. He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class. The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government called commanderies, as well as a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms. These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence, particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States. From the reign of Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BC) onward, the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics, synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu. This policy endured until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912.\n","The Han dynasty saw an age of economic prosperity and witnessed a significant growth of the money economy first established during the Zhou dynasty (c. 1050–256 BC). The coinage minted by the central government in 119 BC remained the standard coinage of China until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). The period saw a number of limited institutional innovations. To finance its military campaigns and the settlement of newly conquered frontier territories, the Han government nationalized the private salt and iron industries in 117 BC, though these government monopolies were later repealed during the Eastern Han dynasty. Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances, including the process of papermaking, the nautical steering ship rudder, the use of negative numbers in mathematics, the raised-relief map, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere for astronomy, and a seismometer employing an inverted pendulum that could be used to discern the cardinal direction of distant earthquakes.\n","The Han dynasty had many conflicts with the Xiongnu, a nomadic confederation centered in the eastern Eurasian steppe. The Xiongnu defeated the Han in 200 BC, prompting the Han to appease the Xiongnu with a policy of marriage alliance and payments of tribute, though the Xiongnu continued to raid the Han's northern borders. Han policy changed in 133 BC, under Emperor Wu, when Han forces began a series of military campaigns to quell the Xiongnu. The Han ultimately defeated the Xiongnu, forcing them to accept vassal status as Han tributaries, and the Xiongnu confederation fragmented. The Han conquered the Hexi Corridor and Inner Asian territory of the Tarim Basin from the Xiongnu, helping to establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road. The lands north of the Han's borders were later overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful conquests in the south, annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC.

The opposing Nationalists were an alliance of Falangists, monarchists, conservatives, and traditionalists led by a military junta among whom General Francisco Franco quickly achieved a preponderant role. Due to the international political climate at the time, the war had many facets and was variously viewed as class struggle, a religious struggle, a struggle between dictatorship and republican democracy, between revolution and counterrevolution, and between fascism and communism.

The cause of the war was the dispute over whether slavery would be permitted to expand into the western territories, leading to more slave states, or be prevented from doing so, which many believed would place slavery on a course of ultimate extinction.\n","Decades of political controversy over slavery were brought to a head by the victory in the 1860 U.S. presidential election of Abraham Lincoln, who opposed slavery's expansion into the western territories. Seven southern slave states responded to Lincoln's victory by seceding from the United States and forming the Confederacy. The Confederacy seized U.S. forts and other federal assets within their borders. Four more southern states seceded after the war began and, led by Confederate President Jefferson Davis, the Confederacy asserted control over about a third of the U.S. population in eleven states. Four years of intense combat, mostly in the South, ensued.\n","During 1861–1862 in the Western Theater, the Union made significant permanent gains—though in the Eastern Theater the conflict was inconclusive. The abolition of slavery became a Union war goal on January 1, 1863, when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared all slaves in rebel states to be free, which applied to more than 3.5 million of the 4 million enslaved people in the country. To the west, the Union first destroyed the Confederacy's river navy by the summer of 1862, then much of its western armies, and later seized New Orleans. The successful 1863 Union siege of Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River. In 1863, Confederate General Robert E. Lee's incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg. Western successes led to General Ulysses S. Grant's command of all Union armies in 1864. Inflicting an ever-tightening naval blockade of Confederate ports, the Union marshaled resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions. This led to the fall of Atlanta in 1864 to Union General William Tecumseh Sherman, followed by his March to the Sea. The last significant battles raged around the ten-month Siege of Petersburg, gateway to the Confederate capital of Richmond. The Confederates abandoned Richmond, and on April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered to Grant following the Battle of Appomattox Court House, setting in motion the end of the war.\n","A wave of Confederate surrenders followed. On April 14, just five days after Lee's surrender, Lincoln was assassinated. On May 26, the last military department of the Confederacy, the Department of the Trans-Mississippi, effectively surrendered, but the conclusion of the American Civil War lacks a clear end date, and Appomattox is often symbolically referred to. Small confederate ground forces continued surrendering past the May 26 surrender date until June 23. By the end of the war, much of the South's infrastructure was destroyed, especially its railroads. The Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and four million enslaved black people were freed. The war-torn nation then entered the Reconstruction era in an attempt to rebuild the country, bring the former Confederate states back into the United States, and grant civil rights to freed slaves.\n","The Civil War is one of the most extensively studied and written about episodes in U.S. history. It remains the subject of cultural and historiographical debate. Of particular interest is the persisting myth of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. The American Civil War was among the first wars to use industrial warfare. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, the ironclad warship, and mass-produced weapons were all widely used during the war. In total, the war left between 620,000 and 750,000 soldiers dead, along\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I now know the general information about the American Civil War.\n","Final Answer: The American Civil War was fought from April 12, 1861 to May 26, 1865 between the Union (\"the North\") and the Confederacy (\"the South\"), which had been formed by states that had seceded from the Union.

The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 mi (64 km) northeast of Delhi. It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east. The rebellion posed a military threat to British power in that region, and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859. \n","The name of the revolt is contested, and it is variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence.The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, as well as scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule. Many Indians rose against the British; however, many also fought for the British, and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule. Violence, which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty, was inflicted on both sides, on British officers, and civilians, including women and children, by the rebels, and on the rebels, and their supporters, including sometimes entire villages, by British reprisals; the cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation.After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut, the rebels quickly reached Delhi, whose 81-year-old Mughal ruler, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was declared the Emperor of Hindustan. Soon, the rebels had captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh (Oudh). The East India Company's response came rapidly as well. With help from reinforcements, Kanpur was retaken by mid-July 1857, and Delhi by the end of September. However, it then took the remainder of 1857 and the better part of 1858 for the rebellion to be suppressed in Jhansi, Lucknow, and especially the Awadh countryside. Other regions of Company-controlled India—Bengal province, the Bombay Presidency, and the Madras Presidency—remained largely calm. In the Punjab, the Sikh princes crucially helped the British by providing both soldiers and support. The large princely states, Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore, and Kashmir, as well as the smaller ones of Rajputana, did not join the rebellion, serving the British, in the Governor-General Lord Canning's words, as \"breakwaters in a storm\".In some regions, most notably in Awadh, the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against British oppression. However, the rebel leaders proclaimed no articles of faith that presaged a new political system. Even so, the rebellion proved to be an important watershed in Indian and British Empire history. It led to the dissolution of the East India Company, and forced the British to reorganize the army, the financial system, and the administration in India, through passage of the Government of India Act 1858. India was thereafter administered directly by the British government in the new British Raj. On 1 November 1858, Queen Victoria issued a proclamation to Indians, which while lacking the authority of a constitutional provision, promised rights similar to those of other British subjects. In the following decades, when admission to these rights was not always forthcoming, Indians were to pointedly refer to the Queen's proclamation in growing avowals of a new nationalism.\n","\n","Page: Names of the Indian Rebellion of 1857\n","Summary: The Indian Rebellion o\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I need to find out when India got independence\n","Action: Wikipedia\n","Action Input: Indian independence\u001b[0m"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/wikipedia/wikipedia.py:389: GuessedAtParserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system (\"lxml\").

Intellectuals such as Rabindranath Tagore, Subramania Bharati, and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay spread patriotic awareness. Female leaders like Sarojini Naidu, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, Pritilata Waddedar, and Kasturba Gandhi promoted the emancipation of Indian women and their participation in the freedom struggle.\n","Few leaders followed a more violent approach, which became especially popular after the Rowlatt Act, which permitted indefinite detention.

Essentially anti-colonial, it was supplemented by visions of independent, economic development with a secular, democratic, republican, and civil-libertarian political structure.

It culminated in the Indian Independence Act 1947, which ended Crown suzerainty and partitioned British Raj into Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan.\n","India remained a Crown Dominion until 26 January 1950, when the Constitution of India established the Republic of India.

It originated from English claims to the French throne. The war grew into a broader power struggle involving factions from across Western Europe, fueled by emerging nationalism on both sides. The periodization of the war takes place over 116 years, wherein the war was interrupted by several years of truces.\n","The Hundred Years' War was a significant conflict in the Middle Ages. During the war, five generations of kings from two rival dynasties fought for the throne of France, which was then the dominant kingdom in Western Europe. The war had a lasting effect on European history. Both sides produced innovations in military technology and tactics, including professional standing armies and artillery, that permanently changed warfare in Europe; chivalry, which reached its height during the conflict, subsequently declined. Stronger national identities took root in both countries, which became more centralised and gradually rose as global powers.The term \"Hundred Years' War\" was adopted by later historians as a historiographical periodisation to encompass related conflicts, constructing the longest military conflict in European history. The war is commonly divided into three phases separated by truces: the Edwardian War (1337–1360), the Caroline War (1369–1389), and the Lancastrian War (1415–1453). Each side drew many allies into the conflict, with English forces initially prevailing; however, the French forces under the House of Valois ultimately retained control over the Kingdom of France. The French and English monarchies, previously intertwined, thereafter remained separate.\n","\n","Page: Hundred Years' War, 1415–1453\n","Summary: The Lancastrian War was the third and final phase of the Hundred Years' War between England and France. It lasted from 1415, when King Henry V of England invaded Normandy, to 1453, when the English lost Bordeaux. It followed a long period of peace from the end of the Caroline War in 1389. The phase is named after the House of Lancaster, the ruling house of the Kingdom of England, to which Henry V belonged.\n","The first half of this phase of the war was dominated by the Kingdom of England. Initial English successes, notably at the famous Battle of Agincourt, coupled with divisions among the French ruling class, allowed the English to gain control of large parts of France. In 1420, the Treaty of Troyes was signed, by which the English king married the French princess Catherine and was made regent of the kingdom and heir to the throne of France. A victory on paper was thus achieved by the English, with their claims now having legal standing. Some of the French nobility refused to recognise the agreement, however, and so military subjugation was still necessary to enforce its provisions. King Henry V and, after his death, his brother John, Duke of Bedford, brought the English to the height of their power in France, with an English king crowned in Paris.\n","The second half of this phase of the war was dominated by the Kingdom of France. French forces counterattacked, inspired by Joan of Arc, La Hire and the Count of Dunois, and aided by the English loss of its main allies, the Dukes of Burgundy and Brittany. Charles VII of France was crowned in Notre-Dame de Reims in 1429, and from then a slow but steady reconquest of English-held French territories ensued. Ultimately the English would be expelled from France and lose all of their continental territories, except the Pale of Calais (which would be re-captured by the French in 1558).\n","The Battle of Castillon (1453) was the final action of the Hundred Years' War, but France and England remained formally at war until the Treaty of Picquigny in 1475. English, and later British monarchs would continue to nominally claim the French throne until 1801, though they would never agai\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I now know the final

The cause of the war was the dispute over whether slavery would be permitted to expand into the western territories, leading to more slave states, or be prevented from doing so, which many believed would place slavery on a course of ultimate extinction.\n","Decades of political controversy over slavery were brought to a head by the victory in the 1860 U.S. presidential election of Abraham Lincoln, who opposed slavery's expansion into the western territories. Seven southern slave states responded to Lincoln's victory by seceding from the United States and forming the Confederacy. The Confederacy seized U.S. forts and other federal assets within their borders. Four more southern states seceded after the war began and, led by Confederate President Jefferson Davis, the Confederacy asserted control over about a third of the U.S. population in eleven states. Four years of intense combat, mostly in the South, ensued.\n","During 1861–1862 in the Western Theater, the Union made significant permanent gains—though in the Eastern Theater the conflict was inconclusive. The abolition of slavery became a Union war goal on January 1, 1863, when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared all slaves in rebel states to be free, which applied to more than 3.5 million of the 4 million enslaved people in the country. To the west, the Union first destroyed the Confederacy's river navy by the summer of 1862, then much of its western armies, and later seized New Orleans. The successful 1863 Union siege of Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River. In 1863, Confederate General Robert E. Lee's incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg. Western successes led to General Ulysses S. Grant's command of all Union armies in 1864. Inflicting an ever-tightening naval blockade of Confederate ports, the Union marshaled resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions. This led to the fall of Atlanta in 1864 to Union General William Tecumseh Sherman, followed by his March to the Sea. The last significant battles raged around the ten-month Siege of Petersburg, gateway to the Confederate capital of Richmond. The Confederates abandoned Richmond, and on April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered to Grant following the Battle of Appomattox Court House, setting in motion the end of the war.\n","A wave of Confederate surrenders followed. On April 14, just five days after Lee's surrender, Lincoln was assassinated. On May 26, the last military department of the Confederacy, the Department of the Trans-Mississippi, effectively surrendered, but the conclusion of the American Civil War lacks a clear end date, and Appomattox is often symbolically referred to. Small confederate ground forces continued surrendering past the May 26 surrender date until June 23. By the end of the war, much of the South's infrastructure was destroyed, especially its railroads. The Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and four million enslaved black people were freed. The war-torn nation then entered the Reconstruction era in an attempt to rebuild the country, bring the former Confederate states back into the United States, and grant civil rights to freed slaves.\n","The Civil War is one of the most extensively studied and written about episodes in U.S. history. It remains the subject of cultural and historiographical debate. Of particular interest is the persisting myth of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. The American Civil War was among the first wars to use industrial warfare. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, the ironclad warship, and mass-produced weapons were all widely used during the war. In total, the war left between 620,000 and 750,000 soldiers dead, along\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\n","Observation: \u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mPage: Han dynasty\n","Summary: The Han dynasty (UK: , US: ; traditional Chinese: 漢朝; simplified Chinese: 汉朝; pinyin: Hàncháo) was an imperial dynasty of China (202 BC – 9 AD, 25–220 AD), established by Liu Bang and ruled by the House of Liu. The dynasty was preceded by the short-lived Qin dynasty (221–207 BC) and a warring interregnum known as the Chu–Han contention (206–202 BC), and it was succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 AD). The dynasty was briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (9–23 AD) established by usurping regent Wang Mang, and is thus separated into two periods—the Western Han (202 BC – 9 AD) and the Eastern Han (25–220 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history, and it has influenced the identity of the Chinese civilization ever since. Modern China's majority ethnic group refer to themselves as the \"Han people\" or \"Han Chinese\". The spoken Sinitic language and written Chinese are referred to respectively as the \"Han language\" and \"Han characters\".The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society. He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class. The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government called commanderies, as well as a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms. These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence, particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States. From the reign of Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BC) onward, the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics, synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu. This policy endured until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912.\n","The Han dynasty saw an age of economic prosperity and witnessed a significant growth of the money economy first established during the Zhou dynasty (c. 1050–256 BC). The coinage minted by the central government in 119 BC remained the standard coinage of China until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). The period saw a number of limited institutional innovations. To finance its military campaigns and the settlement of newly conquered frontier territories, the Han government nationalized the private salt and iron industries in 117 BC, though these government monopolies were later repealed during the Eastern Han dynasty. Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances, including the process of papermaking, the nautical steering ship rudder, the use of negative numbers in mathematics, the raised-relief map, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere for astronomy, and a seismometer employing an inverted pendulum that could be used to discern the cardinal direction of distant earthquakes.\n","The Han dynasty had many conflicts with the Xiongnu, a nomadic confederation centered in the eastern Eurasian steppe. The Xiongnu defeated the Han in 200 BC, prompting the Han to appease the Xiongnu with a policy of marriage alliance and payments of tribute, though the Xiongnu continued to raid the Han's northern borders. Han policy changed in 133 BC, under Emperor Wu, when Han forces began a series of military campaigns to quell the Xiongnu. The Han ultimately defeated the Xiongnu, forcing them to accept vassal status as Han tributaries, and the Xiongnu confederation fragmented. The Han conquered the Hexi Corridor and Inner Asian territory of the Tarim Basin from the Xiongnu, helping to establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road. The lands north of the Han's borders were later overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful conquests in the south, annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC. He further expanded Han territory into the northern Korean Peninsula, where Han forces conquered Gojoseon and established the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies in 108 BC. After 92 AD, the palace eunuchs increasingly involved themselves in the dynasty's\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\n","Observation: \u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mPage: Battle of Waterloo\n","Summary: The Battle of Waterloo (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈʋaːtərloː] ) was fought on Sunday 18 June 1815, near Waterloo (at that time in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, now in Belgium), marking  the end of the Napoleonic Wars. A French army under the command of Napoleon was defeated by two armies of the Seventh Coalition. One of these was a British-led force with units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick, and Nassau, under the command of the Duke of Wellington (often referred to as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army). The other comprised three corps of the Prussian army under Field Marshal von Blücher (the fourth corps of this army fought at the Battle of Wavre on the same day). The battle was known contemporarily as the Battle of Mont Saint-Jean in France or La Belle Alliance (\"the Beautiful Alliance\") in Prussia.Upon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815 (beginning the Hundred Days), many states that had previously opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and hurriedly mobilised their armies. Wellington's and Blücher's armies were cantoned close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately, before they could link up and invade France with other members of the coalition.\n","On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the Battle of Ligny with his main force, while a small portion of the French army contested the Battle of Quatre Bras to prevent the Anglo-allied army from reinforcing the Prussians. The Anglo-allied army held their ground at Quatre Bras, and on the 17th, the Prussians withdrew from Ligny in good order, while Wellington then withdrew in parallel with the Prussians northward to Waterloo on 17 June. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate Battle of Wavre with the Prussian rear-guard on 18–19 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo.\n","Upon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the Mont-Saint-Jean escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of 18 June and almost lost the battle, but was eventually aided by the progressively arriving 50,000 Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening, Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the Imperial Guard. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army repulsed the Imperial Guard, and the French army was routed.\n","Waterloo was the decisive engagement of the Waterloo campaign and Napoleon's last. It was also the second bloodiest single day battle of the Napoleonic Wars, after Borodino. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\". Napoleon abdicated four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. The defeat at Waterloo marked the end of Napoleon's Hundred Days return from exile. It precipitated Napoleon's second and definitive abdication as Emperor of the French, and ended the First French Empire. It set a historical  milestone between serial European wars and decades of relative peace, often referred to as the Pax Britannica.  In popular culture, the phrase \"meeting one's Waterloo\" has become an expression for someone suffering a final defeat, as in the ABBA song \"Waterloo\".\n","The battlefield is located in the Belgian municipalities of Braine-l'Alleud and Lasne, about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) south of Brussels, and about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from the town of Waterloo. The site of the battlefield today is dominated by the monument of the Lion's Mound, a large artificial hill constructed from earth taken from the battlefield itself, but the topography of the battlefield near the mound has not been preserved.\n","\n","Page: Order of battle of \u001b[0m\n","Thought:\n","Observation: \u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mPage: Hundred Years' War\n","Summary: The Hundred Years' War (French: Guerre de Cent Ans; 1337–1453) was a series of armed conflicts fought between the kingdoms of England and France during the Late Middle Ages. It originated from English claims to the French throne. The war grew into a broader power struggle involving factions from across Western Europe, fueled by emerging nationalism on both sides. The periodization of the war takes place over 116 years, wherein the war was interrupted by several years of truces.\n","The Hundred Years' War was a significant conflict in the Middle Ages. During the war, five generations of kings from two rival dynasties fought for the throne of France, which was then the dominant kingdom in Western Europe. The war had a lasting effect on European history. Both sides produced innovations in military technology and tactics, including professional standing armies and artillery, that permanently changed warfare in Europe; chivalry, which reached its height during the conflict, subsequently declined. Stronger national identities took root in both countries, which became more centralised and gradually rose as global powers.The term \"Hundred Years' War\" was adopted by later historians as a historiographical periodisation to encompass related conflicts, constructing the longest military conflict in European history. The war is commonly divided into three phases separated by truces: the Edwardian War (1337–1360), the Caroline War (1369–1389), and the Lancastrian War (1415–1453). Each side drew many allies into the conflict, with English forces initially prevailing; however, the French forces under the House of Valois ultimately retained control over the Kingdom of France. The French and English monarchies, previously intertwined, thereafter remained separate.\n","\n","Page: Hundred Years' War, 1369–1389\n","Summary: The Caroline War was the second phase of the Hundred Years' War between France and England, following the Edwardian War. It was so-named after Charles V of France, who resumed the war nine years after the Treaty of Brétigny (signed 1360). The Kingdom of France dominated this phase of the war.\n","The Black Prince, eldest son and heir of Edward III of England, spent a huge sum of money in order to restore Peter the Cruel to the throne of Castile. The Castilian King was unable to repay him, however, so the Black Prince raised taxes in his domains in Aquitaine. The people's complaints were unheeded, so they appealed to the French King Charles V. In May 1369, the Black Prince received summons from the French king demanding his presence in Paris. The prince refused, and Charles responded by declaring war. He immediately set out to reverse the territorial losses imposed at Brétigny and he was largely successful in his lifetime. His successor, Charles VI, made peace with the son of the Black Prince, Richard II, in 1389. This truce was extended many times until the war was resumed in 1415.\n","\n","Page: Hundred Years' War, 1415–1453\n","Summary: The Lancastrian War was the third and final phase of the Hundred Years' War between England and France. It lasted from 1415, when King Henry V of England invaded Normandy, to 1453, when the English lost Bordeaux. It followed a long period of peace from the end of the Caroline War in 1389. The phase is named after the House of Lancaster, the ruling house of the Kingdom of England, to which Henry V belonged.\n","The first half of this phase of the war was dominated by the Kingdom of England. Initial English successes, notably at the famous Battle of Agincourt, coupled with divisions among the French ruling class, allowed the English to gain control of large parts of France. In 1420, the Treaty of Troyes was signed, by which the English king married the French princess Catherine and was made regent of the kingdom and heir to the throne of France. A victory on paper was thus achieved by the English, with their claims now having legal standing.

Republicans were loyal to the left-leaning Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic, and consisted of various socialist, communist, separatist, anarchist, and republican parties, some of which had opposed the government in the pre-war period. The opposing Nationalists were an alliance of Falangists, monarchists, conservatives, and traditionalists led by a military junta among whom General Francisco Franco quickly achieved a preponderant role. Due to the international political climate at the time, the war had many facets and was variously viewed as class struggle, a religious struggle, a struggle between dictatorship and republican democracy, between revolution and counterrevolution, and between fascism and communism. According to Claude Bowers, U.S. ambassador to Spain during the war, it was the \"dress rehearsal\" for World War II. The Nationalists won the war, which ended in early 1939, and ruled Spain until Franco's death in November 1975.\n","The war began after the partial failure of the coup d'état of July 1936 against the Republican government by a group of generals of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces, with General Emilio Mola as the primary planner and leader and having General José Sanjurjo as a figurehead. The government at the time was a coalition of Republicans, supported in the Cortes by communist and socialist parties, under the leadership of centre-left President Manuel Azaña. The Nationalist faction was supported by a number of conservative groups, including CEDA, monarchists, including both the opposing Alfonsists and the religious conservative Carlists, and the Falange Española de las JONS, a fascist political party. After the deaths of Sanjurjo, Emilio Mola and Manuel Goded Llopis, Franco emerged as the remaining leader of the Nationalist side.\n","The coup was supported by military units in Morocco, Pamplona, Burgos, Zaragoza, Valladolid, Cádiz, Córdoba, and Seville. However, rebelling units in almost all important cities—such as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao, and Málaga—did not gain control, and those cities remained under the control of the government. This left Spain militarily and politically divided. The Nationalists and the Republican government fought for control of the country. The Nationalist forces received munitions, soldiers, and air support from Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany and Portugal, while the Republican side received support from the Soviet Union and Mexico. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, continued to recognise the Republican government but followed an official policy of non-intervention. Despite this policy, tens of thousands of citizens from non-interventionist countries directly participated in the conflict. They fought mostly in the pro-Republican International Brigades, which also included several thousand exiles from pro-Nationalist regimes.\n","The Nationalists advanced from their strongholds in the south and west, capturing most of Spain's northern coastline in 1937. They also besieged Madrid and the area to its south and west for much of the war. After much of Catalonia was captured in 1938 and 1939, and Madrid cut off from Barcelona, the Republican military position became hopeless. Following the fall without resistance of Barcelona in January 1939, the Francoist regime was recognised by France and the United Kingdom in February 1939. On 5 March 1939, in response to an alleged increasing communist dominance of the republican government and the deteriorating military situation, Colonel Segismundo Casado led a military coup against the Republican government, with the intention of seeking peace with the Nationalists. These peace overtures, however, were rejected by Franco. Following internal conflict between Republican factions in Madrid in the same month, Franco enter\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\n","Observation: \u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mPage: Indian Rebellion of 1857\n","Summary: The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major uprising in India in 1857–58 against the rule of the British East India Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown. The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 mi (64 km) northeast of Delhi. It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east. The rebellion posed a military threat to British power in that region, and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859. \n","The name of the revolt is contested, and it is variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence.The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, as well as scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule. Many Indians rose against the British; however, many also fought for the British, and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule. Violence, which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty, was inflicted on both sides, on British officers, and civilians, including women and children, by the rebels, and on the rebels, and their supporters, including sometimes entire villages, by British reprisals; the cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation.After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut, the rebels quickly reached Delhi, whose 81-year-old Mughal ruler, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was declared the Emperor of Hindustan. Soon, the rebels had captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh (Oudh). The East India Company's response came rapidly as well. With help from reinforcements, Kanpur was retaken by mid-July 1857, and Delhi by the end of September. However, it then took the remainder of 1857 and the better part of 1858 for the rebellion to be suppressed in Jhansi, Lucknow, and especially the Awadh countryside. Other regions of Company-controlled India—Bengal province, the Bombay Presidency, and the Madras Presidency—remained largely calm. In the Punjab, the Sikh princes crucially helped the British by providing both soldiers and support. The large princely states, Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore, and Kashmir, as well as the smaller ones of Rajputana, did not join the rebellion, serving the British, in the Governor-General Lord Canning's words, as \"breakwaters in a storm\".In some regions, most notably in Awadh, the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against British oppression. However, the rebel leaders proclaimed no articles of faith that presaged a new political system. Even so, the rebellion proved to be an important watershed in Indian and British Empire history. It led to the dissolution of the East India Company, and forced the British to reorganize the army, the financial system, and the administration in India, through passage of the Government of India Act 1858. India was thereafter administered directly by the British government in the new British Raj. On 1 November 1858, Queen Victoria issued a proclamation to Indians, which while lacking the authority of a constitutional provision, promised rights similar to those of other British subjects. In the following decades, when admission to these rights was not always forthcoming, Indians were to pointedly refer to the Queen's proclamation in growing avowals of a new nationalism.\n","\n","Page: Names of the Indian Rebellion of 1857\n","Summary: The Indian Rebellion o\u001b[0m\n","Thought:"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/wikipedia/wikipedia.py:389: GuessedAtParserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system (\"lxml\").

The other comprised three corps of the Prussian army under Field Marshal von Blücher (the fourth corps of this army fought at the Battle of Wavre on the same day). The battle was known contemporarily as the Battle of Mont Saint-Jean in France or La Belle Alliance (\"the Beautiful Alliance\") in Prussia.Upon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815 (beginning the Hundred Days), many states that had previously opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and hurriedly mobilised their armies. Wellington's and Blücher's armies were cantoned close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately, before they could link up and invade France with other members of the coalition.\n","On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the Battle of Ligny with his main force, while a small portion of the French army contested the Battle of Quatre Bras to prevent the Anglo-allied army from reinforcing the Prussians. The Anglo-allied army held their ground at Quatre Bras, and on the 17th, the Prussians withdrew from Ligny in good order, while Wellington then withdrew in parallel with the Prussians northward to Waterloo on 17 June. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate Battle of Wavre with the Prussian rear-guard on 18–19 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo.\n","Upon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the Mont-Saint-Jean escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of 18 June and almost lost the battle, but was eventually aided by the progressively arriving 50,000 Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening, Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the Imperial Guard. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army repulsed the Imperial Guard, and the French army was routed.\n","Waterloo was the decisive engagement of the Waterloo campaign and Napoleon's last. It was also the second bloodiest single day battle of the Napoleonic Wars, after Borodino. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\". Napoleon abdicated four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. The defeat at Waterloo marked the end of Napoleon's Hundred Days return from exile. It precipitated Napoleon's second and definitive abdication as Emperor of the French, and ended the First French Empire.

It lasted until 1947.\n","The first nationalistic revolutionary movement for Indian independence emerged from Bengal. It later took root in the newly formed Indian National Congress with prominent moderate leaders seeking the right to appear for Indian Civil Service examinations in British India, as well as more economic rights for natives. The first half of the 20th century saw a more radical approach towards self-rule.\n","The stages of the independence struggle in the 1920s were characterized by the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and Congress' adoption of Gandhi's policy of non-violence and civil disobedience. Some of the leading followers of Gandhi's ideology were Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, Vallabhbhai Patel, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Maulana Azad, and others. Intellectuals such as Rabindranath Tagore, Subramania Bharati, and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay spread patriotic awareness. Female leaders like Sarojini Naidu, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, Pritilata Waddedar, and Kasturba Gandhi promoted the emancipation of Indian women and their participation in the freedom struggle.\n","Few leaders followed a more violent approach, which became especially popular after the Rowlatt Act, which permitted indefinite detention. The Act sparked protests across India, especially in the Punjab province, where they were violently suppressed in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.\n","The Indian independence movement was in constant ideological evolution. Essentially anti-colonial, it was supplemented by visions of independent, economic development with a secular, democratic, republican, and civil-libertarian political structure. After the 1930s, the movement took on a strong socialist orientation. It culminated in the Indian Independence Act 1947, which ended Crown suzerainty and partitioned British Raj into Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan.\n","India remained a Crown Dominion until 26 January 1950, when the Constitution of India established the Republic of India. Pakistan remained a dominion until 1956 when it adopted its first constitution. In 1971, East Pakistan declared its own independence as Bangladesh.\n","\n","Page: Indian Rebellion of 1857\n","Summary: The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major uprising in India in 1857–58 against the rule of the British East India Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown. The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 mi (64 km) northeast of Delhi. It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east. The rebellion posed a military threat to British power in that region, and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859. \n","The name of the revolt is contested, and it is variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence.The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, as well as scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule. Many Indians rose against the British; however, many also fought for the British, and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule. Violence, which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty, was inflicted on both sides, on British officers, and civilians, including women and children, by the rebels, and on the rebels\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I now know the final answer\n","Final Answer: The First War of Indian Independence was fought in 1857-1858 and India gained independence in 1947, with a time gap of 89 years.\u001b[0m\n","\n","\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I now know the final answer.\n","Final Answer: The Battle of Waterloo was fought on Sunday 18 June 1815, near Waterloo (at that time in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, now in Belgium).

The Nationalist forces received munitions, soldiers, and air support from Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany and Portugal, while the Republican side received support from the Soviet Union and Mexico.

The dynasty was preceded by the short-lived Qin dynasty (221–207 BC) and a warring interregnum known as the Chu–Han contention (206–202 BC), and it was succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 AD). The dynasty was briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (9–23 AD) established by usurping regent Wang Mang, and is thus separated into two periods—the Western Han (202 BC – 9 AD) and the Eastern Han (25–220 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history, and it has influenced the identity of the Chinese civilization ever since. Modern China's majority ethnic group refer to themselves as the \"Han people\" or \"Han Chinese\". The spoken Sinitic language and written Chinese are referred to respectively as the \"Han language\" and \"Han characters\".The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society. He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class. The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government called commanderies, as well as a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms. These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence, particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States. From the reign of Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BC) onward, the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics, synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu. This policy endured until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912.\n","The Han dynasty saw an age of economic prosperity and witnessed a significant growth of the money economy first established during the Zhou dynasty (c. 1050–256 BC). The coinage minted by the central government in 119 BC remained the standard coinage of China until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). The period saw a number of limited institutional innovations. To finance its military campaigns and the settlement of newly conquered frontier territories, the Han government nationalized the private salt and iron industries in 117 BC, though these government monopolies were later repealed during the Eastern Han dynasty. Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances, including the process of papermaking, the nautical steering ship rudder, the use of negative numbers in mathematics, the raised-relief map, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere for astronomy, and a seismometer employing an inverted pendulum that could be used to discern the cardinal direction of distant earthquakes.\n","The Han dynasty had many conflicts with the Xiongnu, a nomadic confederation centered in the eastern Eurasian steppe. The Xiongnu defeated the Han in 200 BC, prompting the Han to appease the Xiongnu with a policy of marriage alliance and payments of tribute, though the Xiongnu continued to raid the Han's northern borders. Han policy changed in 133 BC, under Emperor Wu, when Han forces began a series of military campaigns to quell the Xiongnu. The Han ultimately defeated the Xiongnu, forcing them to accept vassal status as Han tributaries, and the Xiongnu confederation fragmented. The Han conquered the Hexi Corridor and Inner Asian territory of the Tarim Basin from the Xiongnu, helping to establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road. The lands north of the Han's borders were later overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful conquests in the south, annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC. He further expanded Han territory into the northern Korean Peninsula, where Han forces conquered Gojoseon and established the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies in 108 BC.

The cause of the war was the dispute over whether slavery would be permitted to expand into the western territories, leading to more slave states, or be prevented from doing so, which many believed would place slavery on a course of ultimate extinction.\n","Decades of political controversy over slavery were brought to a head by the victory in the 1860 U.S. presidential election of Abraham Lincoln, who opposed slavery's expansion into the western territories. Seven southern slave states responded to Lincoln's victory by seceding from the United States and forming the Confederacy. The Confederacy seized U.S. forts and other federal assets within their borders. Four more southern states seceded after the war began and, led by Confederate President Jefferson Davis, the Confederacy asserted control over about a third of the U.S. population in eleven states. Four years of intense combat, mostly in the South, ensued.\n","During 1861–1862 in the Western Theater, the Union made significant permanent gains—though in the Eastern Theater the conflict was inconclusive. The abolition of slavery became a Union war goal on January 1, 1863, when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared all slaves in rebel states to be free, which applied to more than 3.5 million of the 4 million enslaved people in the country. To the west, the Union first destroyed the Confederacy's river navy by the summer of 1862, then much of its western armies, and later seized New Orleans. The successful 1863 Union siege of Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River. In 1863, Confederate General Robert E. Lee's incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg. Western successes led to General Ulysses S. Grant's command of all Union armies in 1864. Inflicting an ever-tightening naval blockade of Confederate ports, the Union marshaled resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions. This led to the fall of Atlanta in 1864 to Union General William Tecumseh Sherman, followed by his March to the Sea. The last significant battles raged around the ten-month Siege of Petersburg, gateway to the Confederate capital of Richmond. The Confederates abandoned Richmond, and on April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered to Grant following the Battle of Appomattox Court House, setting in motion the end of the war.\n","A wave of Confederate surrenders followed. On April 14, just five days after Lee's surrender, Lincoln was assassinated. On May 26, the last military department of the Confederacy, the Department of the Trans-Mississippi, effectively surrendered, but the conclusion of the American Civil War lacks a clear end date, and Appomattox is often symbolically referred to. Small confederate ground forces continued surrendering past the May 26 surrender date until June 23. By the end of the war, much of the South's infrastructure was destroyed, especially its railroads. The Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and four million enslaved black people were freed. The war-torn nation then entered the Reconstruction era in an attempt to rebuild the country, bring the former Confederate states back into the United States, and grant civil rights to freed slaves.\n","The Civil War is one of the most extensively studied and written about episodes in U.S. history. It remains the subject of cultural and historiographical debate. Of particular interest is the persisting myth of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. The American Civil War was among the first wars to use industrial warfare. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, the ironclad warship, and mass-produced weapons were all widely used during the war.

On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859. \n","The name of the revolt is contested, and it is variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence.The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, as well as scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule. Many Indians rose against the British; however, many also fought for the British, and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule. Violence, which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty, was inflicted on both sides, on British officers, and civilians, including women and children, by the rebels, and on the rebels, and their supporters, including sometimes entire villages, by British reprisals; the cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation.After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut, the rebels quickly reached Delhi, whose 81-year-old Mughal ruler, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was declared the Emperor of Hindustan. Soon, the rebels had captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh (Oudh). The East India Company's response came rapidly as well. With help from reinforcements, Kanpur was retaken by mid-July 1857, and Delhi by the end of September. However, it then took the remainder of 1857 and the better part of 1858 for the rebellion to be suppressed in Jhansi, Lucknow, and especially the Awadh countryside. Other regions of Company-controlled India—Bengal province, the Bombay Presidency, and the Madras Presidency—remained largely calm. In the Punjab, the Sikh princes crucially helped the British by providing both soldiers and support. The large princely states, Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore, and Kashmir, as well as the smaller ones of Rajputana, did not join the rebellion, serving the British, in the Governor-General Lord Canning's words, as \"breakwaters in a storm\".In some regions, most notably in Awadh, the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against British oppression. However, the rebel leaders proclaimed no articles of faith that presaged a new political system. Even so, the rebellion proved to be an important watershed in Indian and British Empire history. It led to the dissolution of the East India Company, and forced the British to reorganize the army, the financial system, and the administration in India, through passage of the Government of India Act 1858. India was thereafter administered directly by the British government in the new British Raj. On 1 November 1858, Queen Victoria issued a proclamation to Indians, which while lacking the authority of a constitutional provision, promised rights similar to those of other British subjects. In the following decades, when admission to these rights was not always forthcoming, Indians were to pointedly refer to the Queen's proclamation in growing avowals of a new nationalism.\n","\n","Page: Names of the Indian Rebellion of 1857\n","Summary: The Indian Rebellion o\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I need to find out who the leaders were.\n","Action: Wikipedia\n","Action Input: Order of battle of Waterloo\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I now know when the Han dynasty was established and how long it lasted.\n","Final Answer: The Han dynasty was established in 202 BC and lasted until 220 AD, spanning over four centuries.\u001b[0m\n","\n","\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I need to find out when India got independence\n","Action: Wikipedia\n","Action Input: Indian independence\u001b[0m"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/wikipedia/wikipedia.py:389: GuessedAtParserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system (\"lxml\").

The dynasty was preceded by the short-lived Qin dynasty (221–207 BC) and a warring interregnum known as the Chu–Han contention (206–202 BC), and it was succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 AD). The dynasty was briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (9–23 AD) established by usurping regent Wang Mang, and is thus separated into two periods—the Western Han (202 BC – 9 AD) and the Eastern Han (25–220 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history, and it has influenced the identity of the Chinese civilization ever since. Modern China's majority ethnic group refer to themselves as the \"Han people\" or \"Han Chinese\". The spoken Sinitic language and written Chinese are referred to respectively as the \"Han language\" and \"Han characters\".The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society. He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class. The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government called commanderies, as well as a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms. These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence, particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States. From the reign of Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BC) onward, the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics, synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu. This policy endured until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912.\n","The Han dynasty saw an age of economic prosperity and witnessed a significant growth of the money economy first established during the Zhou dynasty (c. 1050–256 BC). The coinage minted by the central government in 119 BC remained the standard coinage of China until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). The period saw a number of limited institutional innovations. To finance its military campaigns and the settlement of newly conquered frontier territories, the Han government nationalized the private salt and iron industries in 117 BC, though these government monopolies were later repealed during the Eastern Han dynasty. Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances, including the process of papermaking, the nautical steering ship rudder, the use of negative numbers in mathematics, the raised-relief map, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere for astronomy, and a seismometer employing an inverted pendulum that could be used to discern the cardinal direction of distant earthquakes.\n","The Han dynasty had many conflicts with the Xiongnu, a nomadic confederation centered in the eastern Eurasian steppe. The Xiongnu defeated the Han in 200 BC, prompting the Han to appease the Xiongnu with a policy of marriage alliance and payments of tribute, though the Xiongnu continued to raid the Han's northern borders. Han policy changed in 133 BC, under Emperor Wu, when Han forces began a series of military campaigns to quell the Xiongnu. The Han ultimately defeated the Xiongnu, forcing them to accept vassal status as Han tributaries, and the Xiongnu confederation fragmented. The Han conquered the Hexi Corridor and Inner Asian territory of the Tarim Basin from the Xiongnu, helping to establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road. The lands north of the Han's borders were later overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful conquests in the south, annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC. He further expanded Han territory into the northern Korean Peninsula, where Han forces conquered Gojoseon and established the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies in 108 BC.

It originated from English claims to the French throne. The war grew into a broader power struggle involving factions from across Western Europe, fueled by emerging nationalism on both sides. The periodization of the war takes place over 116 years, wherein the war was interrupted by several years of truces.\n","The Hundred Years' War was a significant conflict in the Middle Ages. During the war, five generations of kings from two rival dynasties fought for the throne of France, which was then the dominant kingdom in Western Europe. The war had a lasting effect on European history. Both sides produced innovations in military technology and tactics, including professional standing armies and artillery, that permanently changed warfare in Europe; chivalry, which reached its height during the conflict, subsequently declined. Stronger national identities took root in both countries, which became more centralised and gradually rose as global powers.The term \"Hundred Years' War\" was adopted by later historians as a historiographical periodisation to encompass related conflicts, constructing the longest military conflict in European history. The war is commonly divided into three phases separated by truces: the Edwardian War (1337–1360), the Caroline War (1369–1389), and the Lancastrian War (1415–1453). Each side drew many allies into the conflict, with English forces initially prevailing; however, the French forces under the House of Valois ultimately retained control over the Kingdom of France. The French and English monarchies, previously intertwined, thereafter remained separate.\n","\n","Page: Hundred Years' War, 1369–1389\n","Summary: The Caroline War was the second phase of the Hundred Years' War between France and England, following the Edwardian War. It was so-named after Charles V of France, who resumed the war nine years after the Treaty of Brétigny (signed 1360). The Kingdom of France dominated this phase of the war.\n","The Black Prince, eldest son and heir of Edward III of England, spent a huge sum of money in order to restore Peter the Cruel to the throne of Castile. The Castilian King was unable to repay him, however, so the Black Prince raised taxes in his domains in Aquitaine. The people's complaints were unheeded, so they appealed to the French King Charles V. In May 1369, the Black Prince received summons from the French king demanding his presence in Paris. The prince refused, and Charles responded by declaring war. He immediately set out to reverse the territorial losses imposed at Brétigny and he was largely successful in his lifetime. His successor, Charles VI, made peace with the son of the Black Prince, Richard II, in 1389. This truce was extended many times until the war was resumed in 1415.\n","\n","Page: Hundred Years' War, 1415–1453\n","Summary: The Lancastrian War was the third and final phase of the Hundred Years' War between England and France. It lasted from 1415, when King Henry V of England invaded Normandy, to 1453, when the English lost Bordeaux. It followed a long period of peace from the end of the Caroline War in 1389. The phase is named after the House of Lancaster, the ruling house of the Kingdom of England, to which Henry V belonged.\n","The first half of this phase of the war was dominated by the Kingdom of England. Initial English successes, notably at the famous Battle of Agincourt, coupled with divisions among the French ruling class, allowed the English to gain control of large parts of France. In 1420, the Treaty of Troyes was signed, by which the English king married the French princess Catherine and was made regent of the kingdom and heir to the throne of France. A victory on paper was thus achieved by the English, with their claims now having legal standing.

Republicans were loyal to the left-leaning Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic, and consisted of various socialist, communist, separatist, anarchist, and republican parties, some of which had opposed the government in the pre-war period. The opposing Nationalists were an alliance of Falangists, monarchists, conservatives, and traditionalists led by a military junta among whom General Francisco Franco quickly achieved a preponderant role. Due to the international political climate at the time, the war had many facets and was variously viewed as class struggle, a religious struggle, a struggle between dictatorship and republican democracy, between revolution and counterrevolution, and between fascism and communism. According to Claude Bowers, U.S. ambassador to Spain during the war, it was the \"dress rehearsal\" for World War II. The Nationalists won the war, which ended in early 1939, and ruled Spain until Franco's death in November 1975.\n","The war began after the partial failure of the coup d'état of July 1936 against the Republican government by a group of generals of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces, with General Emilio Mola as the primary planner and leader and having General José Sanjurjo as a figurehead. The government at the time was a coalition of Republicans, supported in the Cortes by communist and socialist parties, under the leadership of centre-left President Manuel Azaña. The Nationalist faction was supported by a number of conservative groups, including CEDA, monarchists, including both the opposing Alfonsists and the religious conservative Carlists, and the Falange Española de las JONS, a fascist political party. After the deaths of Sanjurjo, Emilio Mola and Manuel Goded Llopis, Franco emerged as the remaining leader of the Nationalist side.\n","The coup was supported by military units in Morocco, Pamplona, Burgos, Zaragoza, Valladolid, Cádiz, Córdoba, and Seville. However, rebelling units in almost all important cities—such as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao, and Málaga—did not gain control, and those cities remained under the control of the government. This left Spain militarily and politically divided. The Nationalists and the Republican government fought for control of the country. The Nationalist forces received munitions, soldiers, and air support from Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany and Portugal, while the Republican side received support from the Soviet Union and Mexico. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, continued to recognise the Republican government but followed an official policy of non-intervention. Despite this policy, tens of thousands of citizens from non-interventionist countries directly participated in the conflict. They fought mostly in the pro-Republican International Brigades, which also included several thousand exiles from pro-Nationalist regimes.\n","The Nationalists advanced from their strongholds in the south and west, capturing most of Spain's northern coastline in 1937. They also besieged Madrid and the area to its south and west for much of the war. After much of Catalonia was captured in 1938 and 1939, and Madrid cut off from Barcelona, the Republican military position became hopeless. Following the fall without resistance of Barcelona in January 1939, the Francoist regime was recognised by France and the United Kingdom in February 1939. On 5 March 1939, in response to an alleged increasing communist dominance of the republican government and the deteriorating military situation, Colonel Segismundo Casado led a military coup against the Republican government, with the intention of seeking peace with the Nationalists. These peace overtures, however, were rejected by Franco. Following internal conflict between Republican factions in Madrid in the same month, Franco enter\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I need to find out when the war was fought and when India got independence\n","Action: Wikipedia\n","Action Input: First war of Indian independence\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I need to find out when and which countries were involved in the First Hundred Year War.\n","Action: Wikipedia\n","Action Input: First Hundred Year War\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I need to find out when and which countries were involved in the First Hundred Year War.\n","Action: Wikipedia\n","Action Input: First Hundred Year War\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I need to find out when the war was fought and who was involved\n","Action: Wikipedia\n","Action Input: Spanish Civil War\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I need to find out when the war was fought and who was involved.\n","Action: Wikipedia\n","Action Input: American Civil War\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I need to find out when the war was fought and who was involved.\n","Action: Wikipedia\n","Action Input: American Civil War\u001b[0m"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/wikipedia/wikipedia.py:389: GuessedAtParserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system (\"lxml\").

A French army under the command of Napoleon was defeated by two armies of the Seventh Coalition. One of these was a British-led force with units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick, and Nassau, under the command of the Duke of Wellington (often referred to as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army). The other comprised three corps of the Prussian army under Field Marshal von Blücher (the fourth corps of this army fought at the Battle of Wavre on the same day). The battle was known contemporarily as the Battle of Mont Saint-Jean in France or La Belle Alliance (\"the Beautiful Alliance\") in Prussia.Upon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815 (beginning the Hundred Days), many states that had previously opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and hurriedly mobilised their armies. Wellington's and Blücher's armies were cantoned close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately, before they could link up and invade France with other members of the coalition.\n","On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the Battle of Ligny with his main force, while a small portion of the French army contested the Battle of Quatre Bras to prevent the Anglo-allied army from reinforcing the Prussians. The Anglo-allied army held their ground at Quatre Bras, and on the 17th, the Prussians withdrew from Ligny in good order, while Wellington then withdrew in parallel with the Prussians northward to Waterloo on 17 June. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate Battle of Wavre with the Prussian rear-guard on 18–19 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo.\n","Upon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the Mont-Saint-Jean escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of 18 June and almost lost the battle, but was eventually aided by the progressively arriving 50,000 Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening, Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the Imperial Guard. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army repulsed the Imperial Guard, and the French army was routed.\n","Waterloo was the decisive engagement of the Waterloo campaign and Napoleon's last. It was also the second bloodiest single day battle of the Napoleonic Wars, after Borodino. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\". Napoleon abdicated four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. The defeat at Waterloo marked the end of Napoleon's Hundred Days return from exile. It precipitated Napoleon's second and definitive abdication as Emperor of the French, and ended the First French Empire.

The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 mi (64 km) northeast of Delhi. It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east. The rebellion posed a military threat to British power in that region, and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859. \n","The name of the revolt is contested, and it is variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence.The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, as well as scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule. Many Indians rose against the British; however, many also fought for the British, and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule. Violence, which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty, was inflicted on both sides, on British officers, and civilians, including women and children, by the rebels, and on the rebels, and their supporters, including sometimes entire villages, by British reprisals; the cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation.After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut, the rebels quickly reached Delhi, whose 81-year-old Mughal ruler, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was declared the Emperor of Hindustan. Soon, the rebels had captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh (Oudh). The East India Company's response came rapidly as well. With help from reinforcements, Kanpur was retaken by mid-July 1857, and Delhi by the end of September. However, it then took the remainder of 1857 and the better part of 1858 for the rebellion to be suppressed in Jhansi, Lucknow, and especially the Awadh countryside. Other regions of Company-controlled India—Bengal province, the Bombay Presidency, and the Madras Presidency—remained largely calm. In the Punjab, the Sikh princes crucially helped the British by providing both soldiers and support. The large princely states, Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore, and Kashmir, as well as the smaller ones of Rajputana, did not join the rebellion, serving the British, in the Governor-General Lord Canning's words, as \"breakwaters in a storm\".In some regions, most notably in Awadh, the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against British oppression. However, the rebel leaders proclaimed no articles of faith that presaged a new political system. Even so, the rebellion proved to be an important watershed in Indian and British Empire history. It led to the dissolution of the East India Company, and forced the British to reorganize the army, the financial system, and the administration in India, through passage of the Government of India Act 1858. India was thereafter administered directly by the British government in the new British Raj. On 1 November 1858, Queen Victoria issued a proclamation to Indians, which while lacking the authority of a constitutional provision, promised rights similar to those of other British subjects. In the following decades, when admission to these rights was not always forthcoming, Indians were to pointedly refer to the Queen's proclamation in growing avowals of a new nationalism.\n","\n","Page: Names of the Indian Rebellion of 1857\n","Summary: The Indian Rebellion o\u001b[0m\n","Thought:"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/wikipedia/wikipedia.py:389: GuessedAtParserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system (\"lxml\").

Many Indians rose against the British; however, many also fought for the British, and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule. Violence, which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty, was inflicted on both sides, on British officers, and civilians, including women and children, by the rebels, and on the rebels, and their supporters, including sometimes entire villages, by British reprisals; the cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation.After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut, the rebels quickly reached Delhi, whose 81-year-old Mughal ruler, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was declared the Emperor of Hindustan. Soon, the rebels had captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh (Oudh). The East India Company's response came rapidly as well. With help from reinforcements, Kanpur was retaken by mid-July 1857, and Delhi by the end of September. However, it then took the remainder of 1857 and the better part of 1858 for the rebellion to be suppressed in Jhansi, Lucknow, and especially the Awadh countryside. Other regions of Company-controlled India—Bengal province, the Bombay Presidency, and the Madras Presidency—remained largely calm. In the Punjab, the Sikh princes crucially helped the British by providing both soldiers and support. The large princely states, Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore, and Kashmir, as well as the smaller ones of Rajputana, did not join the rebellion, serving the British, in the Governor-General Lord Canning's words, as \"breakwaters in a storm\".In some regions, most notably in Awadh, the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against British oppression. However, the rebel leaders proclaimed no articles of faith that presaged a new political system. Even so, the rebellion proved to be an important watershed in Indian and British Empire history. It led to the dissolution of the East India Company, and forced the British to reorganize the army, the financial system, and the administration in India, through passage of the Government of India Act 1858. India was thereafter administered directly by the British government in the new British Raj. On 1 November 1858, Queen Victoria issued a proclamation to Indians, which while lacking the authority of a constitutional provision, promised rights similar to those of other British subjects. In the following decades, when admission to these rights was not always forthcoming, Indians were to pointedly refer to the Queen's proclamation in growing avowals of a new nationalism.\n","\n","Page: Names of the Indian Rebellion of 1857\n","Summary: The Indian Rebellion o\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I now know the general timeline of the Spanish Civil War and who was involved\n","Final Answer: The Spanish Civil War was fought from 1936 to 1939 between the Republicans and the Nationalists. Republicans were loyal to the left-leaning Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic, and consisted of various socialist, communist, separatist, anarchist, and republican parties, while the Nationalists were an alliance of Falangists, monarchists, conservatives, and traditionalists led by a military junta among whom General Francisco Franco quickly achieved a preponderant role.

Republicans were loyal to the left-leaning Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic, and consisted of various socialist, communist, separatist, anarchist, and republican parties, some of which had opposed the government in the pre-war period. The opposing Nationalists were an alliance of Falangists, monarchists, conservatives, and traditionalists led by a military junta among whom General Francisco Franco quickly achieved a preponderant role. Due to the international political climate at the time, the war had many facets and was variously viewed as class struggle, a religious struggle, a struggle between dictatorship and republican democracy, between revolution and counterrevolution, and between fascism and communism. According to Claude Bowers, U.S. ambassador to Spain during the war, it was the \"dress rehearsal\" for World War II. The Nationalists won the war, which ended in early 1939, and ruled Spain until Franco's death in November 1975.\n","The war began after the partial failure of the coup d'état of July 1936 against the Republican government by a group of generals of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces, with General Emilio Mola as the primary planner and leader and having General José Sanjurjo as a figurehead. The government at the time was a coalition of Republicans, supported in the Cortes by communist and socialist parties, under the leadership of centre-left President Manuel Azaña. The Nationalist faction was supported by a number of conservative groups, including CEDA, monarchists, including both the opposing Alfonsists and the religious conservative Carlists, and the Falange Española de las JONS, a fascist political party. After the deaths of Sanjurjo, Emilio Mola and Manuel Goded Llopis, Franco emerged as the remaining leader of the Nationalist side.\n","The coup was supported by military units in Morocco, Pamplona, Burgos, Zaragoza, Valladolid, Cádiz, Córdoba, and Seville. However, rebelling units in almost all important cities—such as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao, and Málaga—did not gain control, and those cities remained under the control of the government. This left Spain militarily and politically divided. The Nationalists and the Republican government fought for control of the country. The Nationalist forces received munitions, soldiers, and air support from Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany and Portugal, while the Republican side received support from the Soviet Union and Mexico. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, continued to recognise the Republican government but followed an official policy of non-intervention. Despite this policy, tens of thousands of citizens from non-interventionist countries directly participated in the conflict. They fought mostly in the pro-Republican International Brigades, which also included several thousand exiles from pro-Nationalist regimes.\n","The Nationalists advanced from their strongholds in the south and west, capturing most of Spain's northern coastline in 1937. They also besieged Madrid and the area to its south and west for much of the war. After much of Catalonia was captured in 1938 and 1939, and Madrid cut off from Barcelona, the Republican military position became hopeless. Following the fall without resistance of Barcelona in January 1939, the Francoist regime was recognised by France and the United Kingdom in February 1939. On 5 March 1939, in response to an alleged increasing communist dominance of the republican government and the deteriorating military situation, Colonel Segismundo Casado led a military coup against the Republican government, with the intention of seeking peace with the Nationalists. These peace overtures, however, were rejected by Franco. Following internal conflict between Republican factions in Madrid in the same month, Franco enter\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\n","Observation: \u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mPage: Hundred Years' War\n","Summary: The Hundred Years' War (French: Guerre de Cent Ans; 1337–1453) was a series of armed conflicts fought between the kingdoms of England and France during the Late Middle Ages.

Some of the leading followers of Gandhi's ideology were Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, Vallabhbhai Patel, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Maulana Azad, and others. Intellectuals such as Rabindranath Tagore, Subramania Bharati, and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay spread patriotic awareness.

The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 mi (64 km) northeast of Delhi. It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east. The rebellion posed a military threat to British power in that region, and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859. \n","The name of the revolt is contested, and it is variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence.The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, as well as scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule.

A French army under the command of Napoleon was defeated by two armies of the Seventh Coalition. One of these was a British-led force with units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick, and Nassau, under the command of the Duke of Wellington (often referred to as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army). The other comprised three corps of the Prussian army under Field Marshal von Blücher (the fourth corps of this army fought at the Battle of Wavre on the same day). The battle was known contemporarily as the Battle of Mont Saint-Jean in France or La Belle Alliance (\"the Beautiful Alliance\") in Prussia.Upon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815 (beginning the Hundred Days), many states that had previously opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and hurriedly mobilised their armies. Wellington's and Blücher's armies were cantoned close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately, before they could link up and invade France with other members of the coalition.\n","On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the Battle of Ligny with his main force, while a small portion of the French army contested the Battle of Quatre Bras to prevent the Anglo-allied army from reinforcing the Prussians. The Anglo-allied army held their ground at Quatre Bras, and on the 17th, the Prussians withdrew from Ligny in good order, while Wellington then withdrew in parallel with the Prussians northward to Waterloo on 17 June. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate Battle of Wavre with the Prussian rear-guard on 18–19 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo.\n","Upon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the Mont-Saint-Jean escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of 18 June and almost lost the battle, but was eventually aided by the progressively arriving 50,000 Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening, Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the Imperial Guard. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army repulsed the Imperial Guard, and the French army was routed.\n","Waterloo was the decisive engagement of the Waterloo campaign and Napoleon's last. It was also the second bloodiest single day battle of the Napoleonic Wars, after Borodino. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\". Napoleon abdicated four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. The defeat at Waterloo marked the end of Napoleon's Hundred Days return from exile. It precipitated Napoleon's second and definitive abdication as Emperor of the French, and ended the First French Empire. It set a historical  milestone between serial European wars and decades of relative peace, often referred to as the Pax Britannica.

It lasted until 1947.\n","The first nationalistic revolutionary movement for Indian independence emerged from Bengal. It later took root in the newly formed Indian National Congress with prominent moderate leaders seeking the right to appear for Indian Civil Service examinations in British India, as well as more economic rights for natives. The first half of the 20th century saw a more radical approach towards self-rule.\n","The stages of the independence struggle in the 1920s were characterized by the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and Congress' adoption of Gandhi's policy of non-violence and civil disobedience. Some of the leading followers of Gandhi's ideology were Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, Vallabhbhai Patel, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Maulana Azad, and others. Intellectuals such as Rabindranath Tagore, Subramania Bharati, and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay spread patriotic awareness. Female leaders like Sarojini Naidu, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, Pritilata Waddedar, and Kasturba Gandhi promoted the emancipation of Indian women and their participation in the freedom struggle.\n","Few leaders followed a more violent approach, which became especially popular after the Rowlatt Act, which permitted indefinite detention. The Act sparked protests across India, especially in the Punjab province, where they were violently suppressed in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.\n","The Indian independence movement was in constant ideological evolution. Essentially anti-colonial, it was supplemented by visions of independent, economic development with a secular, democratic, republican, and civil-libertarian political structure. After the 1930s, the movement took on a strong socialist orientation. It culminated in the Indian Independence Act 1947, which ended Crown suzerainty and partitioned British Raj into Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan.\n","India remained a Crown Dominion until 26 January 1950, when the Constitution of India established the Republic of India. Pakistan remained a dominion until 1956 when it adopted its first constitution. In 1971, East Pakistan declared its own independence as Bangladesh.\n","\n","Page: Indian Rebellion of 1857\n","Summary: The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major uprising in India in 1857–58 against the rule of the British East India Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown. The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 mi (64 km) northeast of Delhi. It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east. The rebellion posed a military threat to British power in that region, and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859. \n","The name of the revolt is contested, and it is variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence.The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, as well as scepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule. Many Indians rose against the British; however, many also fought for the British, and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule. Violence, which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty, was inflicted on both sides, on British officers, and civilians, including women and children, by the rebels, and on the rebels\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\n","Observation: \u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mPage: Order of battle of the Waterloo campaign\n","Summary: This is the complete order of battle for the four major battles of the Waterloo campaign.\n","\n","Page: Battle of Waterloo\n","Summary: The Battle of Waterloo (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈʋaːtərloː] ) was fought on Sunday 18 June 1815, near Waterloo (at that time in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, now in Belgium), marking  the end of the Napoleonic Wars.

Republicans were loyal to the left-leaning Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic, and consisted of various socialist, communist, separatist, anarchist, and republican parties, while the Nationalists were an alliance of Falangists, monarchists, conservatives, and traditionalists led by a military junta among whom General Francisco Franco quickly achieved a preponderant role.
